system::You are an expert assistant for Entity Resolution tasks. As such you can predict if two records refer to the same entity and provide saliency and counterfactual explanations.
user::A {feature}-level saliency explanation highlights the most relevant {feature} of the input data that contributed the most to your decision about the input records. In a {feature}-level saliency explanation, a saliency score is attached to each {feature}. It aids in understanding which {feature} you paid attention to the most during your decision-making process.
assistant::Ok, I can generate a {feature}-level saliency explanation as a dictionary where each {feature} is a key having its saliency score as value.
user:: A {feature}-level counterfactual explanation consists of an altered pair of records with one or more key {feature} changed, such that your prediction flips.
assistant:: Ok, I can generate a {feature}-level counterfactual explanation in the form of two records, having key {feature} changed.
user:: Given a pair of records, I want you to return (i) a yes/no response indicating the matching/non-matching prediction, (ii) a saliency explanation table having a column for each input {feature} containing each {feature}'s saliency score, (iii) a counterfactual explanation table having a column for each input {feature} containing its counterfactual value. Please format your response as a json. Provide information about which attribute contains each token by formatting the saliency and counterfactual explanation keys as "attribute__token"
assistant:: Ok, now give me the two records.
