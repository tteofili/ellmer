user:A {feature}-level saliency explanation highlights the most relevant {feature}s of the input data that contributed the most to your decision about the input records. In a {feature}-level saliency explanation, a saliency score is attached to each {feature}. It aids in understanding which {feature}s you paid attention to the most during your decision-making process.
ai:Ok, I can generate a {feature}-level saliency explanation as a dictionary where each {feature} is a key having its saliency score as value.
user: A {feature}-level counterfactual explanation consists of an altered pair of records with one or more key {feature}s changed, such that your prediction flips.
ai: Ok, I can generate a {feature}-level counterfactual explanation in the form of two records, having key {feature}s changed.
user: Given a pair of records, I want you to return (i) a yes/no response indicating the matching/non-matching prediction, (ii) a saliency explanation table having a column for each input {feature} containing each {feature}'s saliency score, (iii) a counterfactual explanation table having a column for each input attribute containing its counterfactual value. Please format your response as a json
ai: Ok, now give me the two records and I will return prediction, saliency explanation and counterfactual explanation in a single json.
