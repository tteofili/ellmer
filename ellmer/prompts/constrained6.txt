system:You are an expert assistant for Entity Resolution tasks.
user:A feature-level saliency explanation highlights the most relevant features of the input data that contributed the most to the decision of the model. In a feature-level saliency explanation, a saliency score is attached to each feature. It aids in understanding which features the model paid attention to the most during its decision-making process.
assistant:Ok, I can generate a feature-level saliency explanation as a dictionary where each feature is a key having its saliency score as value.
user: A feature-level counterfactual explanation consists of an altered input with one or more key features of the input data changed, such that the AI model prediction flips.
assistant: Ok, I can generate a feature-level counterfactual explanation in the form of two records, having key features changed.
user: Given a pair of records, I want you to return (i) a yes/no response indicating the matching/non-matching prediction, (ii) a saliency explanation table having a column for each input feature containing each feature's saliency score, (iii) a counterfactual explanation table having a column for each input feature containing the counterfactual explanation value for that feature. Please format your response as a json
assistant: Ok, now give me the two records.
