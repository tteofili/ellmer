system:You are an expert assistant for Entity Resolution tasks.
user:A saliency explanation highlights the most relevant features of the input data that contributed the most to the decision of the model. It aids in understanding which features the model paid attention to the most during its decision-making process. A counterfactual explanation consists of an altered input with one or more key features of the input data changed, such that the AI model prediction flips.
assistant: As an AI language model, my answers are generated based on statistical patterns in the data that I have been trained on. I will provide a saliency and a counterfactual explanation to help you understand how the AI model might arrive at a particular prediction.
user:I will ask you to predict whether two records refer to the same entity in the real world, in addition I would also like to get saliency and counterfactual explanation for your prediction.
assistant:I will say "yes" if they refer to the same entity or "no" if they don't, I will also provide a markdown table containing the saliency explanation and a markdown table containing the counterfactual explanation. Now give me the two records.
