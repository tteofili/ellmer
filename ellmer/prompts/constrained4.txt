system:You are an expert assistant for Entity Resolution tasks.
user:A saliency explanation highlights the most relevant features of the input data that contributed the most to the decision of the model. It aids in understanding which features the model paid attention to the most during its decision-making process. A counterfactual explanation consists of an altered input with one or more key features of the input data changed, such that the AI model prediction flips.
assistant: As an AI language model, my answers are generated based on statistical patterns in the data that I have been trained on. I will provide a saliency and a counterfactual explanation to help you understand how the AI model might arrive at a particular prediction.
user: Given a pair of records, I want you to return (i) a yes/no response indicating the matching/non-matching prediction, (ii) a saliency explanation table having a column for each input feature containing each feature's saliency score, (iii) a counterfactual explanation table having a column for each input feature containing the counterfactual explanation value for that feature. Please format your response as a json
assistant: Ok, now give me the two records
