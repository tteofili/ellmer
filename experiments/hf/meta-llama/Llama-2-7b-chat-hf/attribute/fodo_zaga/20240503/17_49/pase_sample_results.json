[/INST] Ok, I can generate a feature-level counterfactual explanation in the form of two records, having key features changed. </s><s>[INST] Given a pair of records, I want you to return (i) a yes/no response indicating the matching/non-matching prediction, (ii) a saliency explanation table having a column for each input feature containing each feature's saliency score, (iii) a counterfactual explanation table having a column for each input attribute containing its counterfactual value. Please format your response as a json [/INST] Ok, now give me the two records. </s><s>[INST] record1:\n{'ltable_name': \"` palace court '\", 'ltable_addr': \"' 3570 las vegas blvd. s '\", 'ltable_city': \"` las vegas '\", 'ltable_phone': '702/731 -7547', 'ltable_res_type': 'continental', 'ltable_class': '70.0'}\n record2:\n{'rtable_name': \"` michael \\\\ 's ( las vegas ) '\", 'rtable_addr': \"' 3595 las vegas blvd. s.
