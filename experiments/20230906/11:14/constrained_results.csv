Explanation:
- ""match"": false, indicates that the model predicted that the two records do not match.
- ""saliency"": a dictionary containing the saliency score for each feature. The saliency score indicates the importance of each feature in the decision-making process of the model. In this case, the model focused more on the ABV and Style features of both records while comparing them.
- ""counterfactual"": a dictionary containing the counterfactual values for each feature. The counterfactual values represent the minimum change required in each feature to flip the model's prediction. In this case, swapping the values of the Beer Name, Brew Factory Name, Style and ABV features of both records would flip the model's prediction."

Explanation:
- The model predicts a match between the two records (matching: true).
- The saliency explanation table shows the saliency score for each input feature. The scores indicate how much each feature contributed to the model's decision. In this case, the brewery name (ltable_Brew_Factory_Name) has the highest score, indicating that it was the most important feature for the match prediction.
- The counterfactual explanation table shows the counterfactual value for each input feature. These values represent the minimum changes required to flip the model's prediction. In this case, changing the style (ltable_Style) to ""Altbier"" would result in a non-match prediction."

The ""matching"" field is a boolean indicating whether the two records match or not. In this case, the two records do not match, so the value is false.

The ""saliency"" field is a dictionary containing the saliency score for each input feature. A higher score indicates that the feature was more important in the model's decision-making process. In this example, the ""ltable_Style"" and ""rtable_ABV"" features have the highest saliency scores.

The ""counterfactual"" field is a dictionary containing the counterfactual explanation for each input feature. The counterfactual explanation value is the value of the feature that would need to be changed in order to flip the model's prediction. In this example, the counterfactual explanation suggests that if the ""ltable_Beer_Name"", ""ltable_Brew_Factory_Name"", and ""ltable_Style"" features were changed to match the values in the second record, and the ""ltable_ABV"" feature was changed to ""4.90 %"", then the model would predict a match instead of a non-match."

```

The saliency explanation table shows the saliency scores for each input feature. The input feature with the highest saliency score is `ltable_ABV`, indicating that it had the most significant impact on the model's decision. The counterfactual explanation table shows the counterfactual values for each input feature that would have caused the model's prediction to flip. In this case, changing the `ltable_Beer_Name`, `ltable_Brew_Factory_Name`, and `ltable_Style` to the values in `record2` would have caused the model's prediction to change to ""matching""."

Explanation:

- The ""matching"" value is ""true"" because the two records are a match.
- The ""saliency_explanation"" table shows the saliency scores for each feature in both records. The scores indicate how much each feature contributed to the matching/non-matching decision. In this case, the Beer_Name feature has the highest score of 0.5 for both records, indicating that it is the most important feature for the decision.
- The ""counterfactual_explanation"" table shows the counterfactual values for each feature that would need to be changed to flip the matching/non-matching decision. In this case, no feature needs to be changed because the two records are already a match."

Explanation:

The saliency explanation table shows the saliency score for each feature in both the left and right records. The scores add up to 1, indicating the relative importance of each feature in determining the matching/non-matching prediction. In this case, the model paid equal attention to all four features.

The counterfactual explanation table shows an altered version of the input records where the Beer Name, Brew Factory Name, Style, and ABV are swapped between the left and right records. Since the model predicted a non-match for the original input, swapping the features should result in a match."

Explanation:

- The ""matching"" field indicates whether the two records match or not. In this case, the value is true, indicating that the two records match.
- The ""saliency"" field contains a dictionary with each feature's saliency score. The scores are normalized such that they add up to 1.0. The saliency scores indicate the relative importance of each feature in the model's decision-making process. In this case, the Beer_Name feature of the left table is the most important feature, followed by the Brew_Factory_Name feature, while the other features have relatively low importance.
- The ""counterfactual"" field contains a dictionary with the counterfactual explanation for each feature. The counterfactual explanation consists of an altered input with one or more key attributes of the input data changed, such that the AI model prediction flips. In this case, the counterfactual explanation for the left table is the same as the right table, and vice versa."

The `matching` field indicates whether the two records are predicted to match or not. In this case, the model predicts that they do not match.

The `saliency` field contains a dictionary with each input feature as a key and its corresponding saliency score as the value. The saliency score represents the importance of the feature in the model's decision-making process. In this case, the model paid more attention to the `ltable_Brew_Factory_Name` and `rtable_Brew_Factory_Name` features than the other features.

The `counterfactual` field contains a dictionary with each input feature as a key and its corresponding counterfactual value as the value. The counterfactual value is the value of the feature that would need to be changed in order for the model's prediction to flip. In this case, changing the `ltable_Beer_Name` to ""Kern River Dirty Hippie Imperial Red Ale"", `ltable_Brew_Factory_Name` to ""Kern River Brewing"", `ltable_Style` to ""American Strong Ale"", and `ltable_ABV` to 8 would result in a matching prediction."

Explanation:

- The model predicts that the two records do not match.
- The saliency explanation table shows the saliency score for each feature in both records. All features have the same saliency score of 0.2, indicating that the model paid equal attention to all features when making its prediction.
- The counterfactual explanation table shows the counterfactual values for each feature in both records. Switching the values of all features between the two records would result in a matching prediction by the model."

Explanation:

- The ""matching"" field indicates that the two records do not match.
- The ""saliency_explanation"" field shows the saliency scores for each feature in both records. The scores are normalized to add up to 1. The saliency scores indicate that the ABV feature in both records had the highest contribution to the non-matching prediction, followed by the Beer Name and Brew Factory Name features in both records.
- The ""counterfactual_explanation"" field shows the altered values for each feature that would cause the AI model to flip its prediction. In this case, swapping the Beer Name, Brew Factory Name, and Style features in both records would cause the model to predict a match. Also, changing the ABV value in both records to 9.50 would cause the model to predict a match."
