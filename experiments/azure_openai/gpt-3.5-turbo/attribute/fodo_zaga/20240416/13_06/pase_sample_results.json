The `same_entity` field is set to `false` because the two records have different values for the `name` attribute.\n2. The `saliency_scores` field shows the importance of each attribute in making the prediction. In this case, the `city` attribute has a score of 1.0, indicating that it was the most important attribute in determining that the two records do not refer to the same entity.\n3. The `attribute_explanation` field provides a counterfactual explanation for the prediction. For each attribute, it shows the original value in both records and a counterfactual value that would have made the two records refer to the same entity. In this case, the counterfactual values are the same as the original values because there is no single attribute that can be changed to make the two records refer to the same entity."]]}, {"id": 1, "ltuple": {"ltable_name": "` yujean kang \\ 's gourmet chinese cuisine '", "ltable_addr": "'67 n. raymond ave.

The scores range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the most important. In this case, the address, phone number, and class are the most important attributes, while the city is less important.\n\n3. `attribute_explanation` provides a counterfactual explanation for each attribute, explaining how changing that attribute would affect the prediction.
