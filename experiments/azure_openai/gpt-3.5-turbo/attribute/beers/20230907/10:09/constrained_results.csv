The saliency explanation table shows that the ltable_ABV and rtable_Style tokens are the most salient features for the model's prediction. The counterfactual explanation table shows that if the ltable_ABV and rtable_Style were swapped between the two records, the model's prediction would be flipped, indicating a match. The resulting explanation suggests that the model is relying heavily on the ABV and style of the beer to make its prediction."

The saliency explanation shows the contribution of each token to the model's decision. The counterfactual explanation shows the altered input that would have resulted in a different prediction. In this case, the model predicts that the records do not match. The tokens that contributed the most to this prediction were the ABV values, with the ABV value in record1 being higher than the ABV value in record2. The counterfactual explanation shows that if we swapped the records' ABV values, the model would have predicted a match."

Explanation:

- The matching/non-matching prediction is ""yes"" because the two records have the same brewery name and beer name, and the same ABV percentage.

- The saliency explanation shows the saliency score for each token in the input data. The brewery name has the highest score, indicating that it is the most important token in determining the match. The beer name also has a high score, followed by the style and ABV.

- The counterfactual explanation shows the altered input data that would cause the prediction to flip. In this case, changing any of the tokens to the values in the second record would cause the prediction to flip to ""no""."

Explanation:

- The ""matching"" field is set to `false`, indicating that the two records do not match.
- The ""saliency_explanation"" field contains a dictionary with saliency scores for each input token. The higher the score, the more important the token was in the model's decision-making process. In this case, the model paid the most attention to the ""rtable_Brew_Factory_Name"" token, which had a score of 0.09.
- The ""counterfactual_explanation"" field contains an altered version of the inputs that would cause the model's prediction to flip. In this case, we have swapped the values of the ""ltable"" and ""rtable"" fields. The new inputs are such that the model should predict that the two records match."

All tokens have equal saliency scores of 0.25, except for the ""ltable_Style"" and ""rtable_Style"" tokens, which have a higher score of 0.35. This suggests that the model paid more attention to the beer style when making its prediction.
- The ""counterfactual_explanation"" field shows the counterfactual value for each token in both records. In this case, all tokens are left unchanged, indicating that there are no key tokens that, if changed, would cause the model's prediction to flip."

The `matching` field indicates whether the two records match or not. In this case, the value is `false`, indicating that the records do not match.

The `saliency_explanation` field contains a dictionary with a saliency score for each token in both records. The saliency scores represent the importance of each token in the AI model's decision-making process. The higher the score, the more important the token is in determining the prediction. In this example, the model paid more attention to the `rtable_Beer_Name` token, indicating that it was the most important feature in determining the prediction.

The `counterfactual_explanation` field contains a dictionary with the counterfactual explanation value for each token in both records. The counterfactual explanation value represents the minimum value that a token can take in order to flip the model's prediction. In this case, the counterfactual explanation is the same as the original input, since changing any token would not cause the model's prediction to flip."

Explanation:

- The `matching` field is `false` because the two records do not match.
- The `saliency_explanation` field is a dictionary that shows the saliency score for each input token. In this case, all scores are 0 because the model did not use any token to make the prediction.
- The `counterfactual_explanation` field is a dictionary that shows the counterfactual explanation for each input token. It contains the values of the tokens that would make the records match.

Explanation:

- The ""matching"" key indicates that the two records do not match.
- The ""saliency"" key contains a dictionary where each key is an input token and each value is the saliency score for that token. The scores are normalized to sum to 1, so they can be interpreted as the relative importance of each token in the decision-making process. In this case, the saliency scores are roughly evenly distributed across all tokens, indicating that no single token had a particularly strong influence on the decision.
- The ""counterfactual"" key contains a dictionary where each key is an input token and each value is the counterfactual explanation for that token. In this case, the counterfactual explanation is simply the corresponding value from the other record, indicating that if the values for all tokens were swapped between the two records, the model would predict a match instead of a non-match."

The `saliency_explanation` field contains the saliency scores for each input token. These scores indicate how important each token was in the model's decision-making process. In this example, the model paid the most attention to the `rtable_ABV` token, which had a score of 0.4.

The `counterfactual_explanation` field contains the counterfactual explanation values for each input token. These values indicate what values each token would need to have in order for the model's prediction to flip. In this example, the values for each token are the same as the original input, since the model's prediction did not change."

Explanation:

- The ""matching"" key has a boolean value indicating whether the two records match or not. In this case, the value is true, indicating that the two records match.
- The ""saliency"" key contains a dictionary with saliency scores for each token in the two records. The scores are between 0 and 1, and indicate the importance of each token in the matching decision. In this case, the model paid the most attention to the ""ltable_Beer_Name"" and ""rtable_Style"" tokens, both of which have a score above 0.4.
- The ""counterfactual"" key contains an altered version of the input records, with one or more key tokens changed to flip the prediction. In this case, the tokens from the two records are swapped, and the prediction flips from matching to non-matching."

The `matching` field indicates whether the two records are predicted to match or not. In this case, the model predicts that they do not match.

The `saliency_explanation` field contains a dictionary where each key represents a token from the input records and the value represents the saliency score for that token. The saliency score indicates how much the model relied on that token when making its prediction. In this example, the model paid more attention to the tokens ""Red"" and ""Ale"" than to other tokens.

The `counterfactual_explanation` field contains a dictionary where each key represents a token from the input records and the value represents a counterfactual explanation for that token. A counterfactual explanation is an altered version of the input where one or more key tokens have been changed such that the model prediction flips. In this example, changing the ""Beer_Name"" token from ""Hop Around Imperial Red Ale"" to ""Kern River Dirty Hippie Imperial Red Ale"" and changing the ""Brew_Factory_Name"" token from ""Big Bay Brewing Co."" to ""Kern River Brewing"" would result in a matching prediction."

Explanation:

- Matching: The model predicts that the two records do not match (matching=false).
- Saliency: The saliency scores indicate the importance of each token for the model's decision. The scores are normalized between 0 and 1. The model paid more attention to the ABV tokens than to the other tokens, in both records.
- Counterfactual: The counterfactual values represent the minimal changes to the input that would cause the model to flip its prediction. In this case, the counterfactual values for all tokens are set to 0, indicating that no minimal change would cause the model to flip its prediction."
