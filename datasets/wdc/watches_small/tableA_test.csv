These were manufactured in level 7 of the now heritage-listed terrace building, the structure offered optimal lighting conditions for the delicate task of watchmaking. The classic instrument appearance of the cockpit was also reflected in the legendary Bundeswehr chronograph of 1955. The design of the Meister Pilot harks back to this: on the bi-directional rotating bezel the 12 distinctive, concave notches ensure a good grip as well as the unmistakable appearance of the timepiece. The screwed case back features a distinctive element: a specially-designed compass rose, which incorporates the symbolism of classic aviation in the form of an artificial horizon. The riveted leather strap ensures a secure fit on the wrist. The particular construction of the front assembly lends the timepiece an unusual elegance for a pilot watch – and the lightness required for take-off.""@en ",,

                            For a long time, the watch most closely associated with the legendary James Bond franchise was the Rolex Submariner.

In this super-successful Bond outing, in which Pierce Brosnan gives an iconic performance as the renowned British spy, the watch seen on Bond's wrist is very clearly an Omega Seamaster.

                            In both name and spirit, the Calibre 01 represents the first of what is expected to become a series of modernised upgrades for TAG Heuer timepieces masterminded by legend of the watchmaking world, Jean-Claude Biver. This model sees the familiar and iconic shape of the Carrera enhanced with an avant-garde (and larger) case build and a striking skeletonised dial. The 45mm titanium-carbide coated case is modular in design, constructed entirely in-house. The same goes for the movement (a modified version of the brand's superb Cal. 1887), which together with the skeletonisation and the red highlights creates a hi-tech aesthetic that builds on the watch's historical race car legacy.

                            It was in 1904 that Louis Cartier gave a watch to his good friend and aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont that was designed to be worn on the wrist. The Santos watch was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented to make it easier to check the time while flying. It was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, as well as a very early example of the iconic Art Deco style that would influence fashion and watchmaking for decades. The modern Santos watches maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numerals and fully incorporated lugs.

                            For a long time, the watch most closely associated with the legendary James Bond franchise was the Rolex Submariner. That all changed in 1995 with the release of GoldenEye. In this super-successful Bond outing, in which Pierce Brosnan gives an iconic performance as the renowned British spy, the watch seen on Bond's wrist is very clearly an Omega Seamaster. From that day forward, Bond has exclusively worn Omega timepieces, a partnership that has catapulted the brand's already prestigious reputation. A series of dazzling limited editions have appeared through the years—but it all started with this superb model.

The watch was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, and to celebrate the origins of the timepiece, Cartier produced a wonderful series of Santos watches called the Santos 100. Modern Santos watches still maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numeral hour markers and fully incorporated lugs.

					Sportlich-elegante Herren-AutomatikuhrDie Automatikuhr ist eine mechanische Armbanduhr, bei der die Feder bei Armbewegungen des Trägers durch einen Rotor in kleinen Schritten aufgezogen wird.
Der Rotor, der zumeist kugelgelagert ist, bleibt bei Bewegungen des Uhrgehäuses aufgrund seiner Massenträgheit und der Schwerkraft im Raum stehen, wobei ein Drehmoment auf den Aufziehmechanismus ausgeübt wird. Im Normalfall wird die Feder in beide Drehrichtungen aufgezogen. Liegt die Drehbewegung des Gehäuses in der Achse des Rotors, so beruht das Prinzip allein auf dem Trägheitsmoment des Rotors. Dieses Phänomen funktioniert also auch in der Schwerelosigkeit. Bei Drehbewegungen, die senkrecht zur Achse des Rotors stattfinden, kommt die Exzentrizität desselben zum Tragen: Der Rotor ist zumeist nur halbkreisförmig ausgebildet, so dass sein Schwerpunkt nicht mit seiner Achse zusammenfällt. Wird die Uhr nur leicht aus der Horizontalen gedreht, genügt dies gegebenenfalls für eine 180-Grad-Drehung des Rotors. Eine Rutschkupplung verhindert ein Überdrehen der Zugfeder, wenn die Uhr bereits voll aufgezogen ist. Automatikuhren zeichnen sich neben ihrer einfachen Handhabung auch durch einen erheblich gleichmäßigeren Lauf aus, der durch die stets gleichmäßig gespannte Feder ausgelöst wird.  Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon der Marke Junghans.
					

					Das Gehäuse ist aus hochwertigem Edelstahl gefertigt und hat eine fein gebürstete Oberfläche.
					

					Auf dem schwarzen Zifferblatt befindet sich ein Junghans Schriftzug.
					

					Die Zeiger sind aus Edelstahl gefertigt. Die IndizesIndizes ist das deutsche Wort für das lateinische Index. Spricht man von Indizes, dann sind die Zahlen die die Zeit anzeigen (bei vielen Uhren z.B. arabische Zahlen: 3, 6, 9, 12, aber auch z.B. römische Zahlen: III, VI, IX, XII) oder stattdessen die Platzhalter dafür gemeint. Platzhalter können je nach Gestaltung der Uhr die Unterschiedlichsten Formen haben. Uhrenindexe werden oft nicht nur aufgemalt sondern auch aufgesetzt – bei exklusiven Uhren auch veredelt (mit z.B. Gold, Rosegold, Silber, Chrom). Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon und Zeiger sind zudem mit einer umweltfreundlichen Leuchtmasse beschichtet.
					

					Die Uhr verfügt über eine Stopp-Funktion, diese wird über die DrückerDas ist der Teil, mit dem sich eine Funktion der Uhr steuern lässt, bei Savonnettes z. B. das Öffnen des Sprungdeckels, bei Chronographen das Starten, Stoppen und Nullstellen, bei Weltzeituhren das Verstellen der Zonenzeiten. Er befindet sich meist neben der Krone am Gehäuserand.  Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon am Gehäuserand bedient.
					

					Auf dem Zifferblattrand befindet sich eine vollständige MinuterieAuf dem Zifferblatt umlaufende Einteilung der Minuten, oft zwischen zwei Kreise eingefaßt (‘Eisenbahnminuterie = sieht aus wie Eisenbahnschienen) und teilweise mit ‘5’-Minutenzahlen versehen. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon.
					

					Das gewölbte und beidseitig entspiegelte SaphirglasSaphirglas (Al2O3) ist von den üblichen Uhrengläsern das härteste. Lediglich der Diamant und einige Karbide weisen eine größere Härte auf und können Kratzer auf einem Saphirglas verursachen. Da Saphirglas relativ stark spiegelt, wird es häufig mit einer Beschichtung versehen (sog. 'Antireflex-Saphir'), die dann leider nicht dieselbe Widerstandsfähigkeit aufweist. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon schützt die Uhr vor äußeren Einflüssen.
					

					Die zwölfeckige, drehbare LünetteDie Lünette ist Bestandteil des Uhrengehäuses. Es handelt sich dabei um einen Ring mit Nut, der auf das Gehäuse einer tragbaren Uhr montiert ist. Dieser Ring ist entweder fest verschraubt oder drehbar und eignet sich dann als Anzeige bestimmter Werte (Himmelsrichtung, zweite Zeitzone, Geschwindigkeitsmesser.)
 Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon ist ebenfalls aus hochwertigem Edelstahl gefertigt und ist mit einer Minutenskalierung versehen.
					

					Die Uhr wird durch ein präzises Automatikwerk KaliberDas Kaliber beschreibt die Form und die Größe eines Uhrwerks. Die Kalibernummer steht für den Werkstyp einer Uhr. ETA beispielsweise ist einer der größten Schweizer Anbieter mechanischer Werke. Anhand der Nummer kann ein Uhrenmacher im Bedarfsfall die passenden Ersatzteile für einen bestimmte Uhr bestimmen. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon J880.4 angetrieben.
					

					Das Gehäuse hat einen Durchmesser von ca. 43.3 mm, die Höhe beträgt ca. 14.4 mm.
					

					Das Band ist aus hochwertigem Rindsleder mit Vernietung gefertigt und verspricht einen hohen Tragekomfort.
					

					Das Lederband wird mit einer DornschließeEine Dornschließe beschreibt die Verschlussart einer Uhr.  In dem längeren Armbandteil werden löcher gestanzt. Auf der anderen Seite befindet sich die Dornschließe, welche aus einem Dorn und einem Metallbügel in U-Form, diese verhindert, dass der Dorn aus dem Loch rutscht.
Dornschließen sind an diversen Materialien zu finden und erstrecken sich in alle Preisklasse. Häufig findet man Dornschließen bei Lederarmbändern oder Textilarmbändern.

					Informationen zu AutomatikuhrenWas sind eigentlich Automatikuhren?Automatikuhren sind Uhren, welche ein mechanisches Uhrwerk aufweisen und von einem Rotor angetrieben werden. Dieser wird  durch Bewegungen vom Arm bzw. Handgelenk  zum Rotieren gebracht  um die Hauptantriebsfeder aufzuziehen.  Aufgrund dessen wird laufend Energie hergestellt, so dass eine Batterie überflüssig wird. Die Gangabweichungen einer Uhr variieren je nach Fertigung, Kalibrierung beim Hersteller, Lebensstil, sowie Tragegewohnheit des Trägers. Die meisten Automatikuhren haben eine Gangabweichung von -20/+30 Sekunden am Tag.  Dies muss leider akzeptiert werden. Sofern eine höhere Ganggenauigkeit gewünscht ist, sind Uhren mit Chronometerprüfung  eine gute Wahl.  Hier erhalten die Uhren das Bewertungszertifikat COSC, für welches sie im Vorfeld diverse Tests bestehen müssen – erst dann dürfen sie sich als Chronometer bezeichnen. Die Ganggenauigkeit darf maximal -4/+6 Sekunden Abweichung am Tag aufweisen und ist ca. 20 Mal genauer als eine normale Automatikuhr. Um der Ganggenauigkeit positiv entgegen zu wirken spielen die Tragegewohnheiten des Trägers eine große Rolle, denn ein aktiver Uhrenträger kann sich über eine genauere Uhr freuen als ein „passiver“ Uhrenträger.Neben der Ganggenauigkeit spielt auch die Gangreserve eine zentrale Rolle bei Automatikuhren. Die Gangreserve, auch Gangautonomie genannt, bezeichnet die Zeitdauer, in der das Uhrwerk weiterläuft, nachdem sie das letzte Mal bewegt wurde. Hier variiert die Stundenanzahl sehr stark und liegt je nach Uhr zwischen 32 und 60 Stunden.Die Langlebigkeit einer Automatikuhr  kann durch das Verhindern von starken Temperaturschwankungen, unnötigen Stößen, Luftdruckschwankungen und Wasserdruck, sowie das häufige Tragen einer Uhr erheblich verbessert werden. Dies wirkt sich auf alle Teile, insbesondere auf das Uhrwerk, sehr positiv aus.Ein großer Vorteil von Automatikuhren ist, dass sie ohne Batterien auskommen. Des Weiteren entfällt das manuelle Aufziehen der Triebfeder. Somit wird eine lange Haltbarkeit einer Automatikuhr gewährleistet. Das Uhrwerk sollte nach 2-5 Jahren ggf. überholt werden, um die Haltbarkeit weiter sicherzustellen.Zu guter Letzt ist es wichtig zu wissen,  wo der Unterschied zwischen Quarz- und Automatikuhren liegt. Quarzuhren sind im Handel in analoger und digitaler Ausführung erhältlich.  Sie sind elektromechanische oder auch vollelektronische Uhren deren Taktgeber ein elektronischer Oszillator ist. Daher ziehen sie ihre Energie meist aus einer Batterie oder aus Knopfzellen. Einige wenige Ausnahmen gibt es, in denen mechanische Energie über einen Mechanismus  in elektrische Ladung umgewandelt und in Akkus gespeichert wird. Dies ist beispielsweise bei der Linie Seiko Kinetic der Fall. Quarzuhren werden meist als Echtzeituhren bezeichnet. Hieraus lässt sich schließen, dass eine Quarzuhr im Gegensatz zu einer Automatikuhr hinsichtlich der Genauigkeit ganz klar die Nase vorn hat und ohne Bewegung der Uhr absolute Genauigkeit aufweist.Automatikuhren sind besonders interessant für Uhrenkenner. Einen Blickfang stellt der flüssig laufende Sekundenzeiger dar. Häufig sind die Uhren mit einem Glasboden versehen, der einen Blick auf das Uhrwerk und den sich bewegenden Rotor zulässt. Die Faszination der Mechanik einer Uhr liegt ganz klar bei Automatikuhr en!

                            It was in 1904 that Louis Cartier gave a watch to his good friend and aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont that was designed to be worn on the wrist. The Santos watch was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented to make it easier to check the time while flying. It was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, as well as a very early example of the iconic Art Deco style that would influence fashion and watchmaking for decades. The modern Santos watches maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numerals and fully incorporated lugs.

					Modisch-elegante Herren-AutomatikuhrDie Automatikuhr ist eine mechanische Armbanduhr, bei der die Feder bei Armbewegungen des Trägers durch einen Rotor in kleinen Schritten aufgezogen wird.
Der Rotor, der zumeist kugelgelagert ist, bleibt bei Bewegungen des Uhrgehäuses aufgrund seiner Massenträgheit und der Schwerkraft im Raum stehen, wobei ein Drehmoment auf den Aufziehmechanismus ausgeübt wird. Im Normalfall wird die Feder in beide Drehrichtungen aufgezogen. Liegt die Drehbewegung des Gehäuses in der Achse des Rotors, so beruht das Prinzip allein auf dem Trägheitsmoment des Rotors. Dieses Phänomen funktioniert also auch in der Schwerelosigkeit. Bei Drehbewegungen, die senkrecht zur Achse des Rotors stattfinden, kommt die Exzentrizität desselben zum Tragen: Der Rotor ist zumeist nur halbkreisförmig ausgebildet, so dass sein Schwerpunkt nicht mit seiner Achse zusammenfällt. Wird die Uhr nur leicht aus der Horizontalen gedreht, genügt dies gegebenenfalls für eine 180-Grad-Drehung des Rotors. Eine Rutschkupplung verhindert ein Überdrehen der Zugfeder, wenn die Uhr bereits voll aufgezogen ist. Automatikuhren zeichnen sich neben ihrer einfachen Handhabung auch durch einen erheblich gleichmäßigeren Lauf aus, der durch die stets gleichmäßig gespannte Feder ausgelöst wird.  Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon der Marke Seiko.
					

					Das Gehäuse ist aus hochwertigem Edelstahl gefertigt und hat eine fein gebürstete Oberfläche.
					

					Auf dem dunkelblauen Zifferblatt befindet sich ein ""Seiko Automatik Diver´s"" Schriftzug.
					

					Die silberfarbenen Zeiger und IndizesIndizes ist das deutsche Wort für das lateinische Index. Spricht man von Indizes, dann sind die Zahlen die die Zeit anzeigen (bei vielen Uhren z.B. arabische Zahlen: 3, 6, 9, 12, aber auch z.B. römische Zahlen: III, VI, IX, XII) oder stattdessen die Platzhalter dafür gemeint. Platzhalter können je nach Gestaltung der Uhr die Unterschiedlichsten Formen haben. Uhrenindexe werden oft nicht nur aufgemalt sondern auch aufgesetzt – bei exklusiven Uhren auch veredelt (mit z.B. Gold, Rosegold, Silber, Chrom). Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon sind mit einer Leuchtmasse (LumiBrite) gefüllt, damit auch im Dunkeln die Uhrzeit gut lesbar ist.

					Die Uhr wird durch ein spezielles Hardlexglas vor äußeren Einflüssen geschützt.
					

					Die drehbare, blaue Lünette ist mit einer Minutenskalierung versehen. Die Oberfläche ist mit einer TitankarbidauflageTitan (Ti) ist ein chemisches Element und wird zu den Übergangsmetallen gezählt. Titan zeichnet sich durch besondere Festigkeit ,Korrosions- und temperaturbeständigkeit bei geringem Gewicht aus und ist daher für die Verarbeitung in Uhrengehäusen und -bändern besonders geeignet.
Da Titan in reiner Form praktisch nicht vorkommt, wird es aus Titanverbindungen, z.B. dem Titaneisenerz (Ilmenit) oder dem Titandioxid (Rutil) hergestellt. Da dieser Prozess sehr aufwändig ist, kostet Titan etwa das Zehnfache im Vergleich zu Stahl. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon beschichtet.

In manchen Fällen werden die Bohrungen für schnell drehende Triebe und Räder mit Lagersteinen verstärkt. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon.

					Informationen zu AutomatikuhrenWas sind eigentlich Automatikuhren?Automatikuhren sind Uhren, welche ein mechanisches Uhrwerk aufweisen und von einem Rotor angetrieben werden. Dieser wird  durch Bewegungen vom Arm bzw. Handgelenk  zum Rotieren gebracht  um die Hauptantriebsfeder aufzuziehen.  Aufgrund dessen wird laufend Energie hergestellt, so dass eine Batterie überflüssig wird. Die Gangabweichungen einer Uhr variieren je nach Fertigung, Kalibrierung beim Hersteller, Lebensstil, sowie Tragegewohnheit des Trägers. Die meisten Automatikuhren haben eine Gangabweichung von -20/+30 Sekunden am Tag.  Dies muss leider akzeptiert werden. Sofern eine höhere Ganggenauigkeit gewünscht ist, sind Uhren mit Chronometerprüfung  eine gute Wahl.  Hier erhalten die Uhren das Bewertungszertifikat COSC, für welches sie im Vorfeld diverse Tests bestehen müssen – erst dann dürfen sie sich als Chronometer bezeichnen. Die Ganggenauigkeit darf maximal -4/+6 Sekunden Abweichung am Tag aufweisen und ist ca. 20 Mal genauer als eine normale Automatikuhr. Um der Ganggenauigkeit positiv entgegen zu wirken spielen die Tragegewohnheiten des Trägers eine große Rolle, denn ein aktiver Uhrenträger kann sich über eine genauere Uhr freuen als ein „passiver“ Uhrenträger.Neben der Ganggenauigkeit spielt auch die Gangreserve eine zentrale Rolle bei Automatikuhren. Die Gangreserve, auch Gangautonomie genannt, bezeichnet die Zeitdauer, in der das Uhrwerk weiterläuft, nachdem sie das letzte Mal bewegt wurde. Hier variiert die Stundenanzahl sehr stark und liegt je nach Uhr zwischen 32 und 60 Stunden.Die Langlebigkeit einer Automatikuhr  kann durch das Verhindern von starken Temperaturschwankungen, unnötigen Stößen, Luftdruckschwankungen und Wasserdruck, sowie das häufige Tragen einer Uhr erheblich verbessert werden. Dies wirkt sich auf alle Teile, insbesondere auf das Uhrwerk, sehr positiv aus.Ein großer Vorteil von Automatikuhren ist, dass sie ohne Batterien auskommen. Des Weiteren entfällt das manuelle Aufziehen der Triebfeder. Somit wird eine lange Haltbarkeit einer Automatikuhr gewährleistet. Das Uhrwerk sollte nach 2-5 Jahren ggf. überholt werden, um die Haltbarkeit weiter sicherzustellen.Zu guter Letzt ist es wichtig zu wissen,  wo der Unterschied zwischen Quarz- und Automatikuhren liegt. Quarzuhren sind im Handel in analoger und digitaler Ausführung erhältlich.  Sie sind elektromechanische oder auch vollelektronische Uhren deren Taktgeber ein elektronischer Oszillator ist. Daher ziehen sie ihre Energie meist aus einer Batterie oder aus Knopfzellen. Einige wenige Ausnahmen gibt es, in denen mechanische Energie über einen Mechanismus  in elektrische Ladung umgewandelt und in Akkus gespeichert wird. Dies ist beispielsweise bei der Linie Seiko Kinetic der Fall. Quarzuhren werden meist als Echtzeituhren bezeichnet. Hieraus lässt sich schließen, dass eine Quarzuhr im Gegensatz zu einer Automatikuhr hinsichtlich der Genauigkeit ganz klar die Nase vorn hat und ohne Bewegung der Uhr absolute Genauigkeit aufweist.Automatikuhren sind besonders interessant für Uhrenkenner. Einen Blickfang stellt der flüssig laufende Sekundenzeiger dar. Häufig sind die Uhren mit einem Glasboden versehen, der einen Blick auf das Uhrwerk und den sich bewegenden Rotor zulässt. Die Faszination der Mechanik einer Uhr liegt ganz klar bei Automatikuhr en!

                            In both name and spirit, the Calibre 01 represents the first of what is expected to become a series of modernised upgrades for TAG Heuer timepieces masterminded by legend of the watchmaking world, Jean-Claude Biver. This model sees the familiar and iconic shape of the Carrera enhanced with an avant-garde (and larger) case build and a striking skeletonised dial. The 45mm titanium-carbide coated case is modular in design, constructed entirely in-house. The same goes for the movement (a modified version of the brand's superb Cal. 1887), which together with the skeletonisation and the red highlights creates a hi-tech aesthetic that builds on the watch's historical race car legacy.

					Modisch-eleganter ChronographDie Bezeichnung Chronograph leitet sich aus den griechischen Begriffen chronos für „Zeit“ und grapho für „Ich schreibe“ ab und ist die Bezeichnung für eine Stoppuhr.
Erfinder des ersten Chronographen war der Franzose Rieussec im Jahre 1821. Ein Jahr später meldete er auf seine Erfindung ein Patent an. Ein Chronograph verfügt über Stunden- Minuten- und Sekundenzeiger und bietet zusätzlich einen weiteren Mechanismus, der einen meist zentral angeordneten Chronographenzeiger durch manuelle Betätigung eines Drückers aktiviert, deaktiviert und wieder in Nullstellung bringt, ohne das eigentliche Uhrwerk zu beeinflussen. Mit diesem System lassen sich Zeitspannen von einer Minute bis zu 12 Stunden messen, je nach technischer Ausstattung. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon der Marke Nixon
					

					Das Gehäuse ist aus hochwertigem, massivem Edelstahl gefertigt und hat eine gebürstete Oberfläche.
					

					Auf dem schwarzen Zifferblatt befindet sich ein Nixon Schriftzug.

					Die typischen Chronographenfunktionen, wie das Stoppen der Zeit, sind über die DrückerDas ist der Teil, mit dem sich eine Funktion der Uhr steuern lässt, bei Savonnettes z. B. das Öffnen des Sprungdeckels, bei Chronographen das Starten, Stoppen und Nullstellen, bei Weltzeituhren das Verstellen der Zonenzeiten. Er befindet sich meist neben der Krone am Gehäuserand.  Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon am Gehäuserand zu betätigen.

Das Armband wird hierbei nicht vollständig geöffnet, sondern an Scharnieren aufgeklappt und geweitet, sodass man die Uhr problemlos vom Handgelenk bekommt. Noch Fragen?

                            For a long time, the watch most closely associated with the legendary James Bond franchise was the Rolex Submariner. That all changed in 1995 with the release of GoldenEye. In this super-successful Bond outing, in which Pierce Brosnan gives an iconic performance as the renowned British spy, the watch seen on Bond's wrist is very clearly an Omega Seamaster. From that day forward, Bond has exclusively worn Omega timepieces, a partnership that has catapulted the brand's already prestigious reputation. A series of dazzling limited editions have appeared through the years—but it all started with this superb model.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet—which looks even better in this ravishing all-gold model.

					Diese Herrenuhr aus dem Hause Seiko vereinigt modernste Technik und edle Materialien.
					

					Die legendäre Astron-Kollektion mit GPS Solar WeltzeituhrDamals verfügte jeder Ort über eine eigene Uhrzeit. Stand die Sonne am höchsten Punkt, so war es 12 Uhr. 

Dies führte in späterer Zeit zu Verwirrung bezüglich Fahrplänen von Bus oder Bahn.
Ein weltweites Zeitzonensystem wurde erstmals im Jahre 1879 vorgeschlagen - dies führte nach einigen Konferenzen dazu, dass die Erde in 24 Stundenzonen eingeteilt wurde. 
Hier liegen die Differenzen zwischen jeder Zeitzone eine Stunde und somit 23 Stunden maximal zu der jeweils rückwärts gesehenen Zeitzone.

 Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon
					

					Seiko Astron ist die erste weltweit funktionierende Funkarmbanduhr mit GPS-ZeitzonenerkennungEs gibt insgesamt 24 Zeitzonen, die je 15 Längengrade umfassen und beim Nullmeridian beginnen. Beim Übergang von einer zur folgenden Zeitzone verschiebt sich die Zeit um eine Stunde. Je nach Himmelsrichtung verschiebt sich die Zeit entweder eine Stunde nach hinten ( Westen) oder nach vorne (Osten).
Die wichtigsten internationalen Zeitsignale sind: DCF77 (Deutschland) in Mainflingen in Hessen, MSF (Großbritannien) in Anthorn, JJY (Japan), WWV (USA) in Fort Collins, WWVH (USA) auf Hawaii, BPC (China) in Shangqiu

 Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon. Der Name Astron ist bei der japanischen Uhrenmanufaktur kein Unbekannter: 1969 präsentierte Seiko mit der Astron die weltweit erste Quarzarmbanduhr und veränderte die Uhrenindustrie damit nachhaltig. Die neue Astron sorgt nun auf Reisen für eine noch komfortablere Zeitzonenumstellung mit Solarenergie.
					

					Seiko hat die Erde in eine Million Quadrate unterteilt und jedem dieser Quadrate die richtige Zeitzone zugewiesen.
					

					Im Freien kann die Seiko Astron das exakte Zeitsignal der AtomuhrBei der Atomuhr handelt es sich um einen Zeitmesser, dem die hochfrequente Schwingungsdauer bestimmter Atome zugrunde liegt (z.B. Caesium oder Rubidium). Diese werden dann durch ein elektromagnetisches Feld oder optisches Pumpen zu Schwingungen angeregt und synchronisieren so einen Quarzgenerator.  Der Amerikaner Isidor Isaac Rabi (1898-1988) entwickelte die erste Atomuhr an der Columbia University und erhielt dafür im Jahr 1944 den Nobelpreis.
Im Jahr 1973 begann die  Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig damit, Caesiumuhren-Zeitsignale (einschließlich Kalenderangaben und Informationen über die Sommerzeit) über den Langwellensender DCF77 in Mainflingen bei Frankfurt am Main abzustrahlen. Der DCF77-Sender der PTB verbreitet das Zeitsignal auf einer Langwellenfrequenz von 77,5 kHz mit einem Radius von etwa 1.500 km. Im Vereinten Königreich, in Japan und in den USA existieren ähnlich funktionierende Zeitsignalsender. 
 Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon eines GPS-Satelliten empfangen.
					

					Darüber hinaus nutzt die Astron die Vorteile des GPS-Systems zur Standortbestimmung und ZeitzonenerkennungEs gibt insgesamt 24 Zeitzonen, die je 15 Längengrade umfassen und beim Nullmeridian beginnen. Beim Übergang von einer zur folgenden Zeitzone verschiebt sich die Zeit um eine Stunde. Je nach Himmelsrichtung verschiebt sich die Zeit entweder eine Stunde nach hinten ( Westen) oder nach vorne (Osten).

					Die Astro Uhr nutzt die Zeitsignale des GPS-Satellitennetzes, die durch mindestens 24 aktive Satelliten die gesamte Erdoberfläche abdecken.
					

					Für Reisende ist die ZeitzonenumstellungEs gibt insgesamt 24 Zeitzonen, die je 15 Längengrade umfassen und beim Nullmeridian beginnen.

 Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon jetzt so komfortabel wie nie zuvor: Sie müssen sich nur im Freien aufhalten und einen Drücker für sechs Sekunden betätigen, automatisch nimmt Ihre Astron Verbindung zu mindestens vier Satelliten auf, ermittelt Ihren Standort und die dazugehörige Zeitzone und stellt die Uhr in 30 Sekunden auf die aktuelle Ortszeit ein.
					

					Eine Anzeige für eine Zweite Zeitzone - ein Ewiger KalenderEinen ewigen Kalender in die präzise Technik eines Uhrwerks zu integrieren ist keine leichte Aufgabe. Es werden Tag, Wochentag, Wochenzähler, Monat, Jahreszeit, Schaltjahresanzeige und Mondphase über die Jahre hinweg präzise angezeigt, ungeachtet der geraden und ungeraden Monate oder der Schaltjahre. Unsere Zeitrechnung geht auf den gregorianischen Kalender zurück, nach dem das Jahr 365 Tage, 5 Stunden, 48 Minuten und 46 Sekunden dauert. Da uns nach dieser Rechnung jedes Jahr circa sechs Stunden verloren gehen, wird alle vier Jahre ein Schaltjahr eingeschoben, um den Verlust wieder auszugleichen. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon und die automatische Anpassung von Sommerzeit mit nur einem Knopfdruck komplettieren die Ausstattung der Uhr.
					

					Das Solar-Zifferblatt ist weiß mit Leuchtzeigern und -indizes (LumiBrite), damit auch im Dunkeln die genaue Uhrzeit zu erkennen ist.
					

					Auf der 4-Uhr Position befindet sich zudem eine Datumsanzeige und ewiger Kalender bis Februar 2100.
					

					Bei dem Uhrwerk handelt es sich um ein ökologisches Solarwerk 8X53 Werk (Dual Time)
					

					Auf dem schwarzen Zifferblatt befindet sich ein ""Seiko Astro GPS Solar"" Schriftzug.
					

					Das Gehäuse ist aus hochwertigem TitaniumTitan (Ti) ist ein chemisches Element und wird zu den Übergangsmetallen gezählt. Titan zeichnet sich durch besondere Festigkeit ,Korrosions- und temperaturbeständigkeit bei geringem Gewicht aus und ist daher für die Verarbeitung in Uhrengehäusen und -bändern besonders geeignet.
Da Titan in reiner Form praktisch nicht vorkommt, wird es aus Titanverbindungen, z.B. dem Titaneisenerz (Ilmenit) oder dem Titandioxid (Rutil) hergestellt. Da dieser Prozess sehr aufwändig ist, kostet Titan etwa das Zehnfache im Vergleich zu Stahl. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon hergestellt und hat eine fein gebürstete Oberfläche.
					

					Ein doppelt-entspiegeltes SaphirglasSaphirglas (Al2O3) ist von den üblichen Uhrengläsern das härteste. Lediglich der Diamant und einige Karbide weisen eine größere Härte auf und können Kratzer auf einem Saphirglas verursachen. Da Saphirglas relativ stark spiegelt, wird es häufig mit einer Beschichtung versehen (sog. 'Antireflex-Saphir'), die dann leider nicht dieselbe Widerstandsfähigkeit aufweist. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon mit Super-Clear-Beschichtung sorgt für einen klaren Blick auf das Zifferblatt.
					

					Der verschraubter Gehäuseboden und die verschraubte Krone gewähren eine WasserdichtigkeitDie Angaben über die  Wasserdichtigkeit von Uhren führen immer wieder zu Missverständnissen, da die  angegebenen Meterangaben meist wenig Aussagekraft haben. Im Folgenden nun ein  paar Richtlinien, die den richtigen Umgang mit ihrer Uhr und Wasser erleichtern  sollen:
Es kann auch vorkommen, dass die Angabe der Wasserdichtigkeit in Bar statt Metern vorliegt. Dies ist  dann folgendermaßen zu verstehen:
3 bar = 30 m / 5 bar = 50 m  / 10 bar = 100 m / 20 bar = 200 m 	 Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon von 10 bar.

					Modisch-sportliche AutomatikuhrDie Automatikuhr ist eine mechanische Armbanduhr, bei der die Feder bei Armbewegungen des Trägers durch einen Rotor in kleinen Schritten aufgezogen wird.
Der Rotor, der zumeist kugelgelagert ist, bleibt bei Bewegungen des Uhrgehäuses aufgrund seiner Massenträgheit und der Schwerkraft im Raum stehen, wobei ein Drehmoment auf den Aufziehmechanismus ausgeübt wird. Im Normalfall wird die Feder in beide Drehrichtungen aufgezogen. Liegt die Drehbewegung des Gehäuses in der Achse des Rotors, so beruht das Prinzip allein auf dem Trägheitsmoment des Rotors. Dieses Phänomen funktioniert also auch in der Schwerelosigkeit. Bei Drehbewegungen, die senkrecht zur Achse des Rotors stattfinden, kommt die Exzentrizität desselben zum Tragen: Der Rotor ist zumeist nur halbkreisförmig ausgebildet, so dass sein Schwerpunkt nicht mit seiner Achse zusammenfällt. Wird die Uhr nur leicht aus der Horizontalen gedreht, genügt dies gegebenenfalls für eine 180-Grad-Drehung des Rotors. Eine Rutschkupplung verhindert ein Überdrehen der Zugfeder, wenn die Uhr bereits voll aufgezogen ist. Automatikuhren zeichnen sich neben ihrer einfachen Handhabung auch durch einen erheblich gleichmäßigeren Lauf aus, der durch die stets gleichmäßig gespannte Feder ausgelöst wird.  Noch Fragen?

					Auf dem schwarzen Zifferblatt befindet sich ein Seiko 5 Logo.
					

					Die Zeiger und IndizesIndizes ist das deutsche Wort für das lateinische Index. Spricht man von Indizes, dann sind die Zahlen die die Zeit anzeigen (bei vielen Uhren z.B. arabische Zahlen: 3, 6, 9, 12, aber auch z.B. römische Zahlen: III, VI, IX, XII) oder stattdessen die Platzhalter dafür gemeint. Platzhalter können je nach Gestaltung der Uhr die Unterschiedlichsten Formen haben. Uhrenindexe werden oft nicht nur aufgemalt sondern auch aufgesetzt – bei exklusiven Uhren auch veredelt (mit z.B. Gold, Rosegold, Silber, Chrom). Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon haben eine rote Beschichtung und verleihen der Uhr ein modisches Aussehen. Zudem sind sie mit einer LumiBrite Leuchtmasse gefüllt, damit auch im Dunkeln die Uhrzeit gut lesbar ist.

					Informationen zu AutomatikuhrenWas sind eigentlich Automatikuhren?Automatikuhren sind Uhren, welche ein mechanisches Uhrwerk aufweisen und von einem Rotor angetrieben werden. Dieser wird  durch Bewegungen vom Arm bzw. Handgelenk  zum Rotieren gebracht  um die Hauptantriebsfeder aufzuziehen.  Aufgrund dessen wird laufend Energie hergestellt, so dass eine Batterie überflüssig wird. Die Gangabweichungen einer Uhr variieren je nach Fertigung, Kalibrierung beim Hersteller, Lebensstil, sowie Tragegewohnheit des Trägers. Die meisten Automatikuhren haben eine Gangabweichung von -20/+30 Sekunden am Tag.  Dies muss leider akzeptiert werden. Sofern eine höhere Ganggenauigkeit gewünscht ist, sind Uhren mit Chronometerprüfung  eine gute Wahl.  Hier erhalten die Uhren das Bewertungszertifikat COSC, für welches sie im Vorfeld diverse Tests bestehen müssen – erst dann dürfen sie sich als Chronometer bezeichnen. Die Ganggenauigkeit darf maximal -4/+6 Sekunden Abweichung am Tag aufweisen und ist ca. 20 Mal genauer als eine normale Automatikuhr. Um der Ganggenauigkeit positiv entgegen zu wirken spielen die Tragegewohnheiten des Trägers eine große Rolle, denn ein aktiver Uhrenträger kann sich über eine genauere Uhr freuen als ein „passiver“ Uhrenträger.Neben der Ganggenauigkeit spielt auch die Gangreserve eine zentrale Rolle bei Automatikuhren. Die Gangreserve, auch Gangautonomie genannt, bezeichnet die Zeitdauer, in der das Uhrwerk weiterläuft, nachdem sie das letzte Mal bewegt wurde. Hier variiert die Stundenanzahl sehr stark und liegt je nach Uhr zwischen 32 und 60 Stunden.Die Langlebigkeit einer Automatikuhr  kann durch das Verhindern von starken Temperaturschwankungen, unnötigen Stößen, Luftdruckschwankungen und Wasserdruck, sowie das häufige Tragen einer Uhr erheblich verbessert werden. Dies wirkt sich auf alle Teile, insbesondere auf das Uhrwerk, sehr positiv aus.Ein großer Vorteil von Automatikuhren ist, dass sie ohne Batterien auskommen. Des Weiteren entfällt das manuelle Aufziehen der Triebfeder. Somit wird eine lange Haltbarkeit einer Automatikuhr gewährleistet. Das Uhrwerk sollte nach 2-5 Jahren ggf. überholt werden, um die Haltbarkeit weiter sicherzustellen.Zu guter Letzt ist es wichtig zu wissen,  wo der Unterschied zwischen Quarz- und Automatikuhren liegt. Quarzuhren sind im Handel in analoger und digitaler Ausführung erhältlich.  Sie sind elektromechanische oder auch vollelektronische Uhren deren Taktgeber ein elektronischer Oszillator ist. Daher ziehen sie ihre Energie meist aus einer Batterie oder aus Knopfzellen. Einige wenige Ausnahmen gibt es, in denen mechanische Energie über einen Mechanismus  in elektrische Ladung umgewandelt und in Akkus gespeichert wird. Dies ist beispielsweise bei der Linie Seiko Kinetic der Fall. Quarzuhren werden meist als Echtzeituhren bezeichnet. Hieraus lässt sich schließen, dass eine Quarzuhr im Gegensatz zu einer Automatikuhr hinsichtlich der Genauigkeit ganz klar die Nase vorn hat und ohne Bewegung der Uhr absolute Genauigkeit aufweist.Automatikuhren sind besonders interessant für Uhrenkenner. Einen Blickfang stellt der flüssig laufende Sekundenzeiger dar. Häufig sind die Uhren mit einem Glasboden versehen, der einen Blick auf das Uhrwerk und den sich bewegenden Rotor zulässt. Die Faszination der Mechanik einer Uhr liegt ganz klar bei Automatikuhr en!

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade “superalloy” steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. The LN moniker stands for Lunette Noir—signifying that it uses an all-black bezel.

After celebrating its 40th anniversary with The Beatles in 2016, music loving RAYMOND WEIL continues its collaboration with the world’s most famous rock band by releasing a watch paying homage to Abbey Road, the last album recorded by the legendary Fab Four and regarded by some as their most influential composition. This second limited numbered edition of 3,000 watches is a symbol of the timelessness of a group whose success and history are etched in our minds for eternity. 

“I’m a Beatles fan, like probably most other people, but it is true that I have become even more so through meeting the passionate collectors and fans of the band. I have come to grasp the respect and fascination they arouse in people and the impressive heritage that the group left to music. The Beatles have transcended time” said Elie Bernheim, CEO, RAYMOND WEIL. 

Housed in a 39.5mm steel case, the dial of the maestro 'The Beatles “Abbey Road” Limited Edition' is a copy of a vinyl record engraved with microgrooves.  Inspired by the iconic cover depicting The Beatles on the world famous pedestrian crossing, the outlined figures of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr stride along the groove of their landmark record.

At the heart of the dial and on the sapphire crystal case-back of the watch, the most iconic logo in the music industry beats to the tempo of the mechanical self-winding RW200 movement.

RAYMOND WEIL offers collectors and audiophiles a watchmaking classic with three hands, a date display and the timeless figures of those masters of music forever engraved in time and in the history of music.

This model sees the familiar and iconic shape of the Carrera enhanced with an avant-garde (and larger) case build and a striking skeletonised dial. The 45mm titanium-carbide coated case is modular in design, constructed entirely in-house. The same goes for the movement (a modified version of the brand's superb Cal. 1887), which together with the skeletonisation and the red highlights creates a hi-tech aesthetic that builds on the watch's historical race car legacy.

Following from Omega's Marine in 1932, the world's first commercially available diving watch, the legend of the Seamaster officially debuted in 1948. By the time of 1957's 300M, it was among the most dependable and professionally sought dive watches from any brand, and it soon pioneered some of the sporty must-have features we associate with such watches, including unidirectional bezels, phosphorescent hands and the helium escape valve.

These were manufactured in level 7 of the now heritage-listed terrace building, the structure offered optimal lighting conditions for the delicate task of watchmaking. The classic instrument appearance of the cockpit was also reflected in the legendary Bundeswehr chronograph of 1955. The design of the Meister Pilot harks back to this: on the bi-directional rotating bezel the 12 distinctive, concave notches ensure a good grip as well as the unmistakable appearance of the timepiece. The screwed case back features a distinctive element: a specially-designed compass rose, which incorporates the symbolism of classic aviation in the form of an artificial horizon. The riveted leather strap ensures a secure fit on the wrist.

                            For a long time, the watch most closely associated with the legendary James Bond franchise was the Rolex Submariner. That all changed in 1995 with the release of GoldenEye. In this super-successful Bond outing, in which Pierce Brosnan gives an iconic performance as the renowned British spy, the watch seen on Bond's wrist is very clearly an Omega Seamaster. From that day forward, Bond has exclusively worn Omega timepieces, a partnership that has catapulted the brand's already prestigious reputation. A series of dazzling limited editions have appeared through the years—but it all started with this superb model.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet—which looks even better in this ravishing all-gold model.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

After celebrating its 40th anniversary with The Beatles in 2016, music loving RAYMOND WEIL continues its collaboration with the world’s most famous rock band by releasing a watch paying homage to Abbey Road, the last album recorded by the legendary Fab Four and regarded by some as their most influential composition. This second limited numbered edition of 3,000 watches is a symbol of the timelessness of a group whose success and history are etched in our minds for eternity. 

“I’m a Beatles fan, like probably most other people, but it is true that I have become even more so through meeting the passionate collectors and fans of the band. I have come to grasp the respect and fascination they arouse in people and the impressive heritage that the group left to music. The Beatles have transcended time” said Elie Bernheim, CEO, RAYMOND WEIL. 

Housed in a 39.5mm steel case, the dial of the maestro 'The Beatles “Abbey Road” Limited Edition' is a copy of a vinyl record engraved with microgrooves.  Inspired by the iconic cover depicting The Beatles on the world famous pedestrian crossing, the outlined figures of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr stride along the groove of their landmark record.

At the heart of the dial and on the sapphire crystal case-back of the watch, the most iconic logo in the music industry beats to the tempo of the mechanical self-winding RW200 movement.

RAYMOND WEIL offers collectors and audiophiles a watchmaking classic with three hands, a date display and the timeless figures of those masters of music forever engraved in time and in the history of music.

                            Like many of its iconic watch families, Rolex's Milgauss was created in 1956 with a specific market in mind: scientists, power station workers and anyone else exposed to high magnetic fields. It was designed to be able to resist fields up to 1,000 gauss (hence the name—“mille” is Latin for thousand). The watch built a solid reputation with only two models until 1988, and was happily revived two decades later in a modern re-edition that remains faithful to the original purpose and aesthetics—including the beloved lightning bolt hand. This gorgeous GV version (Glace Verte) has a green-tinted dial crystal, and uses a Parachrom-Blu hairspring for even better magnetic and shock resistance.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade “superalloy” steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. The LN moniker stands for Lunette Noir—signifying that it uses an all-black bezel.

                            The Seamaster is one of the most iconic diving watches of all time.

By the time of 1957's 300M, it was among the most dependable and professionally sought dive watches from any brand, and it soon pioneered some of the sporty must-have features we associate with such watches, including unidirectional bezels, phosphorescent hands and the helium escape valve.

					Klassischer Chronoscope / ChronographDie Bezeichnung Chronograph leitet sich aus den griechischen Begriffen chronos für „Zeit“ und grapho für „Ich schreibe“ ab und ist die Bezeichnung für eine Stoppuhr.
Erfinder des ersten Chronographen war der Franzose Rieussec im Jahre 1821. Ein Jahr später meldete er auf seine Erfindung ein Patent an. Ein Chronograph verfügt über Stunden- Minuten- und Sekundenzeiger und bietet zusätzlich einen weiteren Mechanismus, der einen meist zentral angeordneten Chronographenzeiger durch manuelle Betätigung eines Drückers aktiviert, deaktiviert und wieder in Nullstellung bringt, ohne das eigentliche Uhrwerk zu beeinflussen. Mit diesem System lassen sich Zeitspannen von einer Minute bis zu 12 Stunden messen, je nach technischer Ausstattung. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon der Serie Max Bill by Junghans

Platzhalter können je nach Gestaltung der Uhr die Unterschiedlichsten Formen haben. Uhrenindexe werden oft nicht nur aufgemalt sondern auch aufgesetzt – bei exklusiven Uhren auch veredelt (mit z.B.

					Informationen zu AutomatikuhrenWas sind eigentlich Automatikuhren?Automatikuhren sind Uhren, welche ein mechanisches Uhrwerk aufweisen und von einem Rotor angetrieben werden. Dieser wird  durch Bewegungen vom Arm bzw. Handgelenk  zum Rotieren gebracht  um die Hauptantriebsfeder aufzuziehen.  Aufgrund dessen wird laufend Energie hergestellt, so dass eine Batterie überflüssig wird. Die Gangabweichungen einer Uhr variieren je nach Fertigung, Kalibrierung beim Hersteller, Lebensstil, sowie Tragegewohnheit des Trägers. Die meisten Automatikuhren haben eine Gangabweichung von -20/+30 Sekunden am Tag.  Dies muss leider akzeptiert werden. Sofern eine höhere Ganggenauigkeit gewünscht ist, sind Uhren mit Chronometerprüfung  eine gute Wahl.  Hier erhalten die Uhren das Bewertungszertifikat COSC, für welches sie im Vorfeld diverse Tests bestehen müssen – erst dann dürfen sie sich als Chronometer bezeichnen. Die Ganggenauigkeit darf maximal -4/+6 Sekunden Abweichung am Tag aufweisen und ist ca. 20 Mal genauer als eine normale Automatikuhr. Um der Ganggenauigkeit positiv entgegen zu wirken spielen die Tragegewohnheiten des Trägers eine große Rolle, denn ein aktiver Uhrenträger kann sich über eine genauere Uhr freuen als ein „passiver“ Uhrenträger.Neben der Ganggenauigkeit spielt auch die Gangreserve eine zentrale Rolle bei Automatikuhren. Die Gangreserve, auch Gangautonomie genannt, bezeichnet die Zeitdauer, in der das Uhrwerk weiterläuft, nachdem sie das letzte Mal bewegt wurde. Hier variiert die Stundenanzahl sehr stark und liegt je nach Uhr zwischen 32 und 60 Stunden.Die Langlebigkeit einer Automatikuhr  kann durch das Verhindern von starken Temperaturschwankungen, unnötigen Stößen, Luftdruckschwankungen und Wasserdruck, sowie das häufige Tragen einer Uhr erheblich verbessert werden. Dies wirkt sich auf alle Teile, insbesondere auf das Uhrwerk, sehr positiv aus.Ein großer Vorteil von Automatikuhren ist, dass sie ohne Batterien auskommen. Des Weiteren entfällt das manuelle Aufziehen der Triebfeder. Somit wird eine lange Haltbarkeit einer Automatikuhr gewährleistet. Das Uhrwerk sollte nach 2-5 Jahren ggf. überholt werden, um die Haltbarkeit weiter sicherzustellen.Zu guter Letzt ist es wichtig zu wissen,  wo der Unterschied zwischen Quarz- und Automatikuhren liegt. Quarzuhren sind im Handel in analoger und digitaler Ausführung erhältlich.  Sie sind elektromechanische oder auch vollelektronische Uhren deren Taktgeber ein elektronischer Oszillator ist. Daher ziehen sie ihre Energie meist aus einer Batterie oder aus Knopfzellen. Einige wenige Ausnahmen gibt es, in denen mechanische Energie über einen Mechanismus  in elektrische Ladung umgewandelt und in Akkus gespeichert wird. Dies ist beispielsweise bei der Linie Seiko Kinetic der Fall. Quarzuhren werden meist als Echtzeituhren bezeichnet. Hieraus lässt sich schließen, dass eine Quarzuhr im Gegensatz zu einer Automatikuhr hinsichtlich der Genauigkeit ganz klar die Nase vorn hat und ohne Bewegung der Uhr absolute Genauigkeit aufweist.Automatikuhren sind besonders interessant für Uhrenkenner. Einen Blickfang stellt der flüssig laufende Sekundenzeiger dar. Häufig sind die Uhren mit einem Glasboden versehen, der einen Blick auf das Uhrwerk und den sich bewegenden Rotor zulässt. Die Faszination der Mechanik einer Uhr liegt ganz klar bei Automatikuhr en!

                            Like many of its iconic watch families, Rolex's Milgauss was created in 1956 with a specific market in mind: scientists, power station workers and anyone else exposed to high magnetic fields. It was designed to be able to resist fields up to 1,000 gauss (hence the name—“mille” is Latin for thousand). The watch built a solid reputation with only two models until 1988, and was happily revived two decades later in a modern re-edition that remains faithful to the original purpose and aesthetics—including the beloved lightning bolt hand. This gorgeous GV version (Glace Verte) has a green-tinted dial crystal, and uses a Parachrom-Blu hairspring for even better magnetic and shock resistance.

This model sees the familiar and iconic shape of the Carrera enhanced with an avant-garde (and larger) case build and a striking skeletonised dial.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

These were manufactured in level 7 of the now heritage-listed terrace building, the structure offered optimal lighting conditions for the delicate task of watchmaking. The classic instrument appearance of the cockpit was also reflected in the legendary Bundeswehr chronograph of 1955. The design of the Meister Pilot harks back to this: on the bi-directional rotating bezel the 12 distinctive, concave notches ensure a good grip as well as the unmistakable appearance of the timepiece. The screwed case back features a distinctive element: a specially-designed compass rose, which incorporates the symbolism of classic aviation in the form of an artificial horizon. The riveted leather strap ensures a secure fit on the wrist. The particular construction of the front assembly lends the timepiece an unusual elegance for a pilot watch – and the lightness required for take-off.""@en ",,

                            For a long time, the watch most closely associated with the legendary James Bond franchise was the Rolex Submariner. That all changed in 1995 with the release of GoldenEye. In this super-successful Bond outing, in which Pierce Brosnan gives an iconic performance as the renowned British spy, the watch seen on Bond's wrist is very clearly an Omega Seamaster. From that day forward, Bond has exclusively worn Omega timepieces, a partnership that has catapulted the brand's already prestigious reputation. A series of dazzling limited editions have appeared through the years—but it all started with this superb model.

These were manufactured in level 7 of the now heritage-listed terrace building, the structure offered optimal lighting conditions for the delicate task of watchmaking. The classic instrument appearance of the cockpit was also reflected in the legendary Bundeswehr chronograph of 1955. The design of the Meister Pilot harks back to this: on the bi-directional rotating bezel the 12 distinctive, concave notches ensure a good grip as well as the unmistakable appearance of the timepiece.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade “superalloy” steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. The LN moniker stands for Lunette Noir—signifying that it uses an all-black bezel.

After celebrating its 40th anniversary with The Beatles in 2016, music loving RAYMOND WEIL continues its collaboration with the world’s most famous rock band by releasing a watch paying homage to Abbey Road, the last album recorded by the legendary Fab Four and regarded by some as their most influential composition. This second limited numbered edition of 3,000 watches is a symbol of the timelessness of a group whose success and history are etched in our minds for eternity. 

“I’m a Beatles fan, like probably most other people, but it is true that I have become even more so through meeting the passionate collectors and fans of the band. I have come to grasp the respect and fascination they arouse in people and the impressive heritage that the group left to music. The Beatles have transcended time” said Elie Bernheim, CEO, RAYMOND WEIL. 

Housed in a 39.5mm steel case, the dial of the maestro 'The Beatles “Abbey Road” Limited Edition' is a copy of a vinyl record engraved with microgrooves.  Inspired by the iconic cover depicting The Beatles on the world famous pedestrian crossing, the outlined figures of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr stride along the groove of their landmark record.

At the heart of the dial and on the sapphire crystal case-back of the watch, the most iconic logo in the music industry beats to the tempo of the mechanical self-winding RW200 movement.

RAYMOND WEIL offers collectors and audiophiles a watchmaking classic with three hands, a date display and the timeless figures of those masters of music forever engraved in time and in the history of music.

					Modisch-eleganter ChronographDie Bezeichnung Chronograph leitet sich aus den griechischen Begriffen chronos für „Zeit“ und grapho für „Ich schreibe“ ab und ist die Bezeichnung für eine Stoppuhr.
Erfinder des ersten Chronographen war der Franzose Rieussec im Jahre 1821. Ein Jahr später meldete er auf seine Erfindung ein Patent an. Ein Chronograph verfügt über Stunden- Minuten- und Sekundenzeiger und bietet zusätzlich einen weiteren Mechanismus, der einen meist zentral angeordneten Chronographenzeiger durch manuelle Betätigung eines Drückers aktiviert, deaktiviert und wieder in Nullstellung bringt, ohne das eigentliche Uhrwerk zu beeinflussen. Mit diesem System lassen sich Zeitspannen von einer Minute bis zu 12 Stunden messen, je nach technischer Ausstattung. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon der Marke Nixon
					

					Das Gehäuse ist aus hochwertigem, massivem Edelstahl gefertigt und hat eine gebürstete Oberfläche.
					

					Auf dem schwarzen Zifferblatt befindet sich ein Nixon Schriftzug.
					

					Die Zeiger und IndizesIndizes ist das deutsche Wort für das lateinische Index. Spricht man von Indizes, dann sind die Zahlen die die Zeit anzeigen (bei vielen Uhren z.B. arabische Zahlen: 3, 6, 9, 12, aber auch z.B. römische Zahlen: III, VI, IX, XII) oder stattdessen die Platzhalter dafür gemeint. Platzhalter können je nach Gestaltung der Uhr die Unterschiedlichsten Formen haben. Uhrenindexe werden oft nicht nur aufgemalt sondern auch aufgesetzt – bei exklusiven Uhren auch veredelt (mit z.B. Gold, Rosegold, Silber, Chrom). Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon sind ebenfalls aus Edelstahl gefertigt.
					

					Die typischen Chronographenfunktionen, wie das Stoppen der Zeit, sind über die DrückerDas ist der Teil, mit dem sich eine Funktion der Uhr steuern lässt, bei Savonnettes z. B. das Öffnen des Sprungdeckels, bei Chronographen das Starten, Stoppen und Nullstellen, bei Weltzeituhren das Verstellen der Zonenzeiten. Er befindet sich meist neben der Krone am Gehäuserand.  Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon am Gehäuserand zu betätigen.
					

					Die Uhr verfügt zudem über eine Datumsanzeige.
					

					Ein Mineralglas schützt die Uhr vor äußeren Einflüssen.
					

					Das Gehäuse hat einen Durchmesser von ca. 37 mm.
					

					Ein Mineralglas schützt das Zifferblatt vor äußeren Einflüssen.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet—which looks even better in this ravishing all-gold model.

                            Like many of its iconic watch families, Rolex's Milgauss was created in 1956 with a specific market in mind: scientists, power station workers and anyone else exposed to high magnetic fields. It was designed to be able to resist fields up to 1,000 gauss (hence the name—“mille” is Latin for thousand). The watch built a solid reputation with only two models until 1988, and was happily revived two decades later in a modern re-edition that remains faithful to the original purpose and aesthetics—including the beloved lightning bolt hand. This gorgeous GV version (Glace Verte) has a green-tinted dial crystal, and uses a Parachrom-Blu hairspring for even better magnetic and shock resistance.

					Modisch-elegante Herren-AutomatikuhrDie Automatikuhr ist eine mechanische Armbanduhr, bei der die Feder bei Armbewegungen des Trägers durch einen Rotor in kleinen Schritten aufgezogen wird.
Der Rotor, der zumeist kugelgelagert ist, bleibt bei Bewegungen des Uhrgehäuses aufgrund seiner Massenträgheit und der Schwerkraft im Raum stehen, wobei ein Drehmoment auf den Aufziehmechanismus ausgeübt wird. Im Normalfall wird die Feder in beide Drehrichtungen aufgezogen. Liegt die Drehbewegung des Gehäuses in der Achse des Rotors, so beruht das Prinzip allein auf dem Trägheitsmoment des Rotors. Dieses Phänomen funktioniert also auch in der Schwerelosigkeit. Bei Drehbewegungen, die senkrecht zur Achse des Rotors stattfinden, kommt die Exzentrizität desselben zum Tragen: Der Rotor ist zumeist nur halbkreisförmig ausgebildet, so dass sein Schwerpunkt nicht mit seiner Achse zusammenfällt. Wird die Uhr nur leicht aus der Horizontalen gedreht, genügt dies gegebenenfalls für eine 180-Grad-Drehung des Rotors. Eine Rutschkupplung verhindert ein Überdrehen der Zugfeder, wenn die Uhr bereits voll aufgezogen ist. Automatikuhren zeichnen sich neben ihrer einfachen Handhabung auch durch einen erheblich gleichmäßigeren Lauf aus, der durch die stets gleichmäßig gespannte Feder ausgelöst wird.  Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon der Marke Seiko.
					

					Das Gehäuse ist aus hochwertigem Edelstahl gefertigt und hat eine fein gebürstete Oberfläche.
					

					Auf dem dunkelblauen Zifferblatt befindet sich ein ""Seiko Automatik Diver´s"" Schriftzug.
					

					Die silberfarbenen Zeiger und IndizesIndizes ist das deutsche Wort für das lateinische Index. Spricht man von Indizes, dann sind die Zahlen die die Zeit anzeigen (bei vielen Uhren z.B. arabische Zahlen: 3, 6, 9, 12, aber auch z.B. römische Zahlen: III, VI, IX, XII) oder stattdessen die Platzhalter dafür gemeint. Platzhalter können je nach Gestaltung der Uhr die Unterschiedlichsten Formen haben. Uhrenindexe werden oft nicht nur aufgemalt sondern auch aufgesetzt – bei exklusiven Uhren auch veredelt (mit z.B. Gold, Rosegold, Silber, Chrom). Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon sind mit einer Leuchtmasse (LumiBrite) gefüllt, damit auch im Dunkeln die Uhrzeit gut lesbar ist.
					

					Auf der 3-Uhr Position befindet sich eine Datums- und Wochentagsanzeige.

					Die Uhr wird durch ein spezielles Hardlexglas vor äußeren Einflüssen geschützt.
					

					Die drehbare, blaue Lünette ist mit einer Minutenskalierung versehen. Die Oberfläche ist mit einer TitankarbidauflageTitan (Ti) ist ein chemisches Element und wird zu den Übergangsmetallen gezählt. Titan zeichnet sich durch besondere Festigkeit ,Korrosions- und temperaturbeständigkeit bei geringem Gewicht aus und ist daher für die Verarbeitung in Uhrengehäusen und -bändern besonders geeignet.
Da Titan in reiner Form praktisch nicht vorkommt, wird es aus Titanverbindungen, z.B. dem Titaneisenerz (Ilmenit) oder dem Titandioxid (Rutil) hergestellt. Da dieser Prozess sehr aufwändig ist, kostet Titan etwa das Zehnfache im Vergleich zu Stahl. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon beschichtet.
					

					Die Uhr wird durch ein Kaliber 4R36 Werk angetrieben. Das Automatikwerk besteht aus 169 Werkteilen und 24 LagersteinenDas Lager einer Uhr sind kleine Bohrungen für die Zapfen des Räderwerks. In manchen Fällen werden die Bohrungen für schnell drehende Triebe und Räder mit Lagersteinen verstärkt. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon.
					

					Die Gangreserve
Als Gangreserve bezeichnet man den Zeitraum, in dem eine Uhr läuft ohne aufgezogen werden zu müssen. Die Gangreserveanzeige beschreibt die verbleibende Zeit bis zum Stillstand einer mechanischen Uhr und gibt so Auskunft, wann eine Uhr erneut aufgezogen werden sollte.
 Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikon beträgt 41 Stunden.
					

					Die Uhr verfügt über eine beidseitige, automatische HandaufzugmHandaufzug ist die manuelle Form eine Uhr zum Laufen zu bringen. Dabei wird die Aufzugskrone von Hand gespannt und sorgt so für eine Gangreserve von 38-40 Stunden. Noch Fragen? Hier geht es zum Uhren-Lexikonöglichkeit.

					Informationen zu AutomatikuhrenWas sind eigentlich Automatikuhren?Automatikuhren sind Uhren, welche ein mechanisches Uhrwerk aufweisen und von einem Rotor angetrieben werden. Dieser wird  durch Bewegungen vom Arm bzw. Handgelenk  zum Rotieren gebracht  um die Hauptantriebsfeder aufzuziehen.  Aufgrund dessen wird laufend Energie hergestellt, so dass eine Batterie überflüssig wird. Die Gangabweichungen einer Uhr variieren je nach Fertigung, Kalibrierung beim Hersteller, Lebensstil, sowie Tragegewohnheit des Trägers. Die meisten Automatikuhren haben eine Gangabweichung von -20/+30 Sekunden am Tag.  Dies muss leider akzeptiert werden. Sofern eine höhere Ganggenauigkeit gewünscht ist, sind Uhren mit Chronometerprüfung  eine gute Wahl.  Hier erhalten die Uhren das Bewertungszertifikat COSC, für welches sie im Vorfeld diverse Tests bestehen müssen – erst dann dürfen sie sich als Chronometer bezeichnen. Die Ganggenauigkeit darf maximal -4/+6 Sekunden Abweichung am Tag aufweisen und ist ca. 20 Mal genauer als eine normale Automatikuhr. Um der Ganggenauigkeit positiv entgegen zu wirken spielen die Tragegewohnheiten des Trägers eine große Rolle, denn ein aktiver Uhrenträger kann sich über eine genauere Uhr freuen als ein „passiver“ Uhrenträger.Neben der Ganggenauigkeit spielt auch die Gangreserve eine zentrale Rolle bei Automatikuhren. Die Gangreserve, auch Gangautonomie genannt, bezeichnet die Zeitdauer, in der das Uhrwerk weiterläuft, nachdem sie das letzte Mal bewegt wurde. Hier variiert die Stundenanzahl sehr stark und liegt je nach Uhr zwischen 32 und 60 Stunden.Die Langlebigkeit einer Automatikuhr  kann durch das Verhindern von starken Temperaturschwankungen, unnötigen Stößen, Luftdruckschwankungen und Wasserdruck, sowie das häufige Tragen einer Uhr erheblich verbessert werden. Dies wirkt sich auf alle Teile, insbesondere auf das Uhrwerk, sehr positiv aus.Ein großer Vorteil von Automatikuhren ist, dass sie ohne Batterien auskommen. Des Weiteren entfällt das manuelle Aufziehen der Triebfeder. Somit wird eine lange Haltbarkeit einer Automatikuhr gewährleistet. Das Uhrwerk sollte nach 2-5 Jahren ggf. überholt werden, um die Haltbarkeit weiter sicherzustellen.Zu guter Letzt ist es wichtig zu wissen,  wo der Unterschied zwischen Quarz- und Automatikuhren liegt. Quarzuhren sind im Handel in analoger und digitaler Ausführung erhältlich.  Sie sind elektromechanische oder auch vollelektronische Uhren deren Taktgeber ein elektronischer Oszillator ist. Daher ziehen sie ihre Energie meist aus einer Batterie oder aus Knopfzellen. Einige wenige Ausnahmen gibt es, in denen mechanische Energie über einen Mechanismus  in elektrische Ladung umgewandelt und in Akkus gespeichert wird. Dies ist beispielsweise bei der Linie Seiko Kinetic der Fall. Quarzuhren werden meist als Echtzeituhren bezeichnet. Hieraus lässt sich schließen, dass eine Quarzuhr im Gegensatz zu einer Automatikuhr hinsichtlich der Genauigkeit ganz klar die Nase vorn hat und ohne Bewegung der Uhr absolute Genauigkeit aufweist.Automatikuhren sind besonders interessant für Uhrenkenner. Einen Blickfang stellt der flüssig laufende Sekundenzeiger dar. Häufig sind die Uhren mit einem Glasboden versehen, der einen Blick auf das Uhrwerk und den sich bewegenden Rotor zulässt. Die Faszination der Mechanik einer Uhr liegt ganz klar bei Automatikuhr en!

                            It was in 1904 that Louis Cartier gave a watch to his good friend and aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont that was designed to be worn on the wrist. The Santos watch was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented to make it easier to check the time while flying. It was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, as well as a very early example of the iconic Art Deco style that would influence fashion and watchmaking for decades. The modern Santos watches maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numerals and fully incorporated lugs.

                            The Seamaster is one of the most iconic diving watches of all time. Following from Omega's Marine in 1932, the world's first commercially available diving watch, the legend of the Seamaster officially debuted in 1948. By the time of 1957's 300M, it was among the most dependable and professionally sought dive watches from any brand, and it soon pioneered some of the sporty must-have features we associate with such watches, including unidirectional bezels, phosphorescent hands and the helium escape valve. This excellent model is a closely related sister watch to the version made famous by Pierce Brosnan as James Bond in 1995's GoldenEye—kicking off Bond's attachment to the Seamaster that continues to this day.

                            It was in 1904 that Louis Cartier gave a watch to his good friend and aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont that was designed to be worn on the wrist. The Santos watch was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented to make it easier to check the time while flying. It was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, as well as a very early example of the iconic Art Deco style that would influence fashion and watchmaking for decades. The modern Santos watches maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numerals and fully incorporated lugs.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

The classic instrument appearance of the cockpit was also reflected in the legendary Bundeswehr chronograph of 1955. The design of the Meister Pilot harks back to this: on the bi-directional rotating bezel the 12 distinctive, concave notches ensure a good grip as well as the unmistakable appearance of the timepiece. The screwed case back features a distinctive element: a specially-designed compass rose, which incorporates the symbolism of classic aviation in the form of an artificial horizon.

After celebrating its 40th anniversary with The Beatles in 2016, music loving RAYMOND WEIL continues its collaboration with the world’s most famous rock band by releasing a watch paying homage to Abbey Road, the last album recorded by the legendary Fab Four and regarded by some as their most influential composition. This second limited numbered edition of 3,000 watches is a symbol of the timelessness of a group whose success and history are etched in our minds for eternity. 

“I’m a Beatles fan, like probably most other people, but it is true that I have become even more so through meeting the passionate collectors and fans of the band. I have come to grasp the respect and fascination they arouse in people and the impressive heritage that the group left to music. The Beatles have transcended time” said Elie Bernheim, CEO, RAYMOND WEIL. 

Housed in a 39.5mm steel case, the dial of the maestro 'The Beatles “Abbey Road” Limited Edition' is a copy of a vinyl record engraved with microgrooves.  Inspired by the iconic cover depicting The Beatles on the world famous pedestrian crossing, the outlined figures of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr stride along the groove of their landmark record.

At the heart of the dial and on the sapphire crystal case-back of the watch, the most iconic logo in the music industry beats to the tempo of the mechanical self-winding RW200 movement.

RAYMOND WEIL offers collectors and audiophiles a watchmaking classic with three hands, a date display and the timeless figures of those masters of music forever engraved in time and in the history of music.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet—which looks even better in this ravishing all-gold model.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            Like many of its iconic watch families, Rolex's Milgauss was created in 1956 with a specific market in mind: scientists, power station workers and anyone else exposed to high magnetic fields. It was designed to be able to resist fields up to 1,000 gauss (hence the name—“mille” is Latin for thousand). The watch built a solid reputation with only two models until 1988, and was happily revived two decades later in a modern re-edition that remains faithful to the original purpose and aesthetics—including the beloved lightning bolt hand. This gorgeous GV version (Glace Verte) has a green-tinted dial crystal, and uses a Parachrom-Blu hairspring for even better magnetic and shock resistance.

After celebrating its 40th anniversary with The Beatles in 2016, music loving RAYMOND WEIL continues its collaboration with the world’s most famous rock band by releasing a watch paying homage to Abbey Road, the last album recorded by the legendary Fab Four and regarded by some as their most influential composition. This second limited numbered edition of 3,000 watches is a symbol of the timelessness of a group whose success and history are etched in our minds for eternity. 

“I’m a Beatles fan, like probably most other people, but it is true that I have become even more so through meeting the passionate collectors and fans of the band. I have come to grasp the respect and fascination they arouse in people and the impressive heritage that the group left to music. The Beatles have transcended time” said Elie Bernheim, CEO, RAYMOND WEIL. 

Housed in a 39.5mm steel case, the dial of the maestro 'The Beatles “Abbey Road” Limited Edition' is a copy of a vinyl record engraved with microgrooves.  Inspired by the iconic cover depicting The Beatles on the world famous pedestrian crossing, the outlined figures of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr stride along the groove of their landmark record.

At the heart of the dial and on the sapphire crystal case-back of the watch, the most iconic logo in the music industry beats to the tempo of the mechanical self-winding RW200 movement.

RAYMOND WEIL offers collectors and audiophiles a watchmaking classic with three hands, a date display and the timeless figures of those masters of music forever engraved in time and in the history of music.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            It was in 1904 that Louis Cartier gave a watch to his good friend and aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont that was designed to be worn on the wrist. The Santos watch was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented to make it easier to check the time while flying. It was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, as well as a very early example of the iconic Art Deco style that would influence fashion and watchmaking for decades. The modern Santos watches maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numerals and fully incorporated lugs.

                            The Seamaster is one of the most iconic diving watches of all time. Following from Omega's Marine in 1932, the world's first commercially available diving watch, the legend of the Seamaster officially debuted in 1948. By the time of 1957's 300M, it was among the most dependable and professionally sought dive watches from any brand, and it soon pioneered some of the sporty must-have features we associate with such watches, including unidirectional bezels, phosphorescent hands and the helium escape valve.
