Leave the camera for stationary recording of subjects such as astronomical observation, flowers coming into bloom or slow moving clouds. The series of consequential images can be combined to produce a time lapse video.

Stop Motion Animation

The Stop Motion Animation function enables the production of stop motion (stop frame) video on the camera with pictures that were sequentially shot while moving the object by degrees. This effect gives the illusion of the object moving by itself.

Plongez au coeur des détails, vivez des instants mémorables.


La nature ne laisse pas de place aux temps morts. Un constat qui s’applique chez Carl Zeiss. Les nouveaux modèles CONQUEST HD en sont la concrétisation. Une révolution en matière de Design, d‘ergonomie et d‘optique. La quintessence de la polyvalence „Made in Germany“, qui unit la qualité traditionnelle ZEISS et la technologie de dernière génération. Tout ceci avec un rapport qualité-prix remarquable. L’ensemble de ces caractéristiques permet aux modèles de jumelles Zeiss CONQUEST HD d’être considérés comme étant la meilleure façon de découvrir les produits haut de gamme ZEISS, sans le moindre compromis. 

Grâce au nouveau bloc de lentilles HD, les modèles CONQUEST HD peuvent déployer tous leurs talents en matière de qualité d’image et de fidélité chromatique. Le champ de vision particulièrement large qui permet de découvrir la nature sous un autre angle en est un bon exemple, ainsi que le traitement LotuTec® qui garantit une excellente visibilité par tous les temps et facilite le nettoyage.
Le traitement multi-couches Carl Zeiss T* dont bénéficient les modèles CONQUEST HD permet de profiter, grâce à sa transmission de plus de 90%, d’observations crépusculaires de bonne qualité.

Robustes, compacts et légers, les modèles CONQUEST HD sont particulièrement discrets en termes d’encombrement, mais se font d’autant plus remarquer en termes de qualité d’image. Le nouveau Design est toutefois incomparable, tandis que l’ergonomie et la maniabilité assurent une mise au point précise même avec des gants.

Its equivalent focal length in FX-format is 82.5-450mm. This lens is an excellent choice for travel, landscapes, portraits, and distant subjects. The lens focuses to 4.6' at every focal length - this versatility ensures stunning close-up shots of subjects near and far.</p>
<p>The VR II image stabilization allows you to handhold the your camera at up to 4 shutter speeds slower than would otherwise be possible, assuring dramatically sharper still images and stable video capture. Other features include the silent wave motor for quiet accurate autofocusing, and a rounded 9-blade diaphragm that offers stunning out-of-focus highlights (bokeh). The lens elements have been treated with Nikon's Super Integrated Coating - an optical lens coating process that maximizes light transmission while enhancing clarity and contrast. All of these world-class features add up to the AF-S 55-300 being an ideal lens for traveling or shooting close to home.</p>""@en ",,

The surface of the tubing is painstakingly machined to create a rough texture to ensure a non-slip surface. The 2-1/2 grip head consists of a pair of rotating aluminum discs attached to a 5/8 (16 mm) receiver. The discs have four different sized V shaped jaws to accept any accessory with a 5/8, 1/2, 3/8 or 1/4 mounting stud or tubing. The V shaped jaws have teeth that grab whatever is mounted between the plates securely. The 2-1/2 grip head features an oversized ergonomic T handle and dedicated roller bearings designed for maximum torque. The grip head uses a non-slip aluminum friction disc that will maintain its durability over time that offers the user positive locking strength and precise control, and is constructed around a solid steel central bolt with a fixed solid pin to secure it to the aluminum casting for increased strength and durability. The 40 grip arm is almost always used in conjunction with a 2 1/2 grip head, giving you complete flexibility to position gobo go between the light and a subject such as flags, scrims and silks as well as other accessories virtually anywhere.""

Building on the popularity and versatility of broad focal range lenses, the new NIKKOR AF-S 28-300mm VR II is Nikon’s first FX-format lens with a 10.7x zoom range ideal for enthusiasts and professionals. The AF-S 28-300mm VR II is the all-in-one optical solution that is ideal for capturing landscapes, portraits and distant subjects. This lens is optimized for edge-to-edge sharpness on both FX and DX-format digital SLR cameras, and has an equivalent focal length of 42-450mm when attached to a DX-format digital SLR. Its optical formula includes two ED glass elements that effectively minimize chromatic aberration, even at the widest aperture settings, as well as three Aspherical Lens Elements that virtually eliminate coma and other aberrations at wide aperture settings. This high performance lens also incorporates an M/A Focus Mode Switch that enables quick changes between manual and autofocus operation, and Internal Focus (IF) providing fast and quiet autofocus without changing the length of the lens while retaining working distance through the focus range.

The surface of the tubing is painstakingly machined to create a rough texture to ensure a non-slip surface. The 2-1/2 grip head consists of a pair of rotating aluminum discs attached to a 5/8 (16 mm) receiver. The discs have four different sized V shaped jaws to accept any accessory with a 5/8, 1/2, 3/8 or 1/4 mounting stud or tubing. The V shaped jaws have teeth that grab whatever is mounted between the plates securely. The 2-1/2 grip head features an oversized ergonomic T handle and dedicated roller bearings designed for maximum torque. The grip head uses a non-slip aluminum friction disc that will maintain its durability over time that offers the user positive locking strength and precise control, and is constructed around a solid steel central bolt with a fixed solid pin to secure it to the aluminum casting for increased strength and durability.

It connects to your Canon HDSLR via USB and interfaces with the camera and lens firmware directly in order to control focus operations, live view, record start/stop &amp; shutter release, and more.<br />
<br />
- 3-step, ultra-precise focus speed <br />
- Fixed or variable focus control modes <br />
- Customizable focus speed limit <br />
- Focus Memory settings <br />
- Live View control <br />
- Auto Focus control <br />
- Live View Digital Zoom control <br />
- Video recording start/stop <br />
- Photo shutter release <br />
- Remote control battery status <br />
- Customizable focus direction <br />
- Recording LED <br />
- Video and Photo LED <br />
- Clamp fits the spacer supplied with SYMPLA<br />
<br />
Along with the Deluxe model, the Clamp-On remote control unit promises real innovation in the field of HDSLR filming by circumventing the need for any physical contact between follow-focus equipment and the camera lens, instead wiring directly into the camera body to use the internal focus control systems.<br />
The advantages are obvious: lenses can be swapped easily without extra hardware or adjustment, nothing jolts the camera unexpectedly during follow-focus, one-man camera operation is easier, and control at a distance is as simple as extending the cable between the camera and the remote. The Clamp-On Remote is perfectly integrated into the SYMPLA system, fitting comfortably to the spacer element of a SYMPLA Adjustable Handle and allowing fingertip control of key camera functions without moving the hand from the grips, in turn making support more stable and secure. <br />

To support the higher capacity needs, SD cards are now requiring a different design. The new SD 2.0 specifications - which supports 4GB and up - is called Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC). The SD Association has created and defined 3 speed classes to help you identify speed and performance capabilities/minimum requirements of SDHC cards and their SDHC host products. Cards address data (read and write) at numerous speeds. Many factors impede this performance. SDHC guarantees a minimum read and write speed necessary to handle recording high quality video and audio. The maximum card speed may vary, but you can always depend on SDHC cards to meet your SDHC host product's high quality performance requirements. Because SDHC works differently (supports the new higher capacity cards) this new card format is not backwards compatible with legacy SD format host devices.""@en-US ",,

                        Pictures can appear very different and achieve various expressions depending on how you manipulate the light. But lighting a shot is not at all difficult with the SB-300 Speedlight. Its flash head can be set up to 120 degrees upward allowing you to bounce light off ceiling or wall to endow a softer, more natural look to your subject. You can easily control the lighting to capture a beautiful indoor portrait creatively.

                        The acclaimed Tamron 18-270mm VC ultra zoom for APS-C format DSLRs has reached an astonishing new level of compactness, performance, and speed with the addition of PZD (Piezo Drive), an innovative ultrasonic autofocus motor based on an advanced piezoelectric design. The result is a lens that's considerably lighter, and noticeably shorter and slimmer (filter diameter: 62mm) than any previous lens in its class, and provides faster, quieter auto-focusing.
Signature features that have made this amazingly versatile lens the world standard in its class have been retained. They include a 28-419mm equivalent (15X) zoom range, an improved, lightweight, compact Vibration Compensation (VC) system, macro focusing to 0.49m (19.3 inches) throughout, and, of course, superlative imaging performance.
Note: This lens is for Nikon mount.

			Das HS-GP3+ Gehäuse ist wasserdicht bis 90m und kompatibel mit GoPro Hero3, Hero3+ und Hero4. Das 10Bar Gehäuse bietet mit seiner großen und geraden linsen auch unter Wasser die von GoPro gewohnte Schärfe und Brillanz. Das 10Bar Gehäuse HS-GP3 bietet die faszinierende GoPro Bild-und Videoqualität nun auch im Unterwassereinsatz. Während die original GoPro Linse auf den Überwasser-Einsatz optimiert ist und kompakte Bauform mit überragender Schärfe verbindet, schwächt sich diese Performance unter Wasser ab.   Merkmale:   - Das Unterwassergehäuse, gefertigt aus Aluminium, ist das ideale Gehäuse für diejenigen, die mit ihrer GoPro tiefer als mit dem originalen GoPro-Unterwassergehäuse zulässig, tauchen möchten. - Durch die maximale Einsatztiefe von 90m und die kleine Bauform ist dieses Gehäuse optimal für technische Taucher geeignet, die keine große Kameraausrüstung mitnehmen wollen. - Es sind alle Kamerafunktionen im Gehäuse bedienbar. - In Verbindung mit einer Blitzschiene und einer Videoleuchte sind eindrucksvolle Filmaufnahmen machbar.Spezifikations:         - Material: Aluminium, rostfreier Stahl, Acetal- CNC-gefertigt- Schwarz eloxiert- Alle Bedienelemente sind durchgeführt.- max.

Customers have been very happy with their purchases of the Veho – Muvi  HD PRO 1080p HD Mini Camcorder:

“I bought this as I wanted an HD Video for use on a forthcoming motorcycle trackday. Having decided that the Go-Pro was the benchmark, but feeling unable to justify the purchase price as I was unsure how much use the camera would get I opted the Muvi after a lot of desk based research and looking at clips on You Tube and have not been disappointed, the quality of the unit and the numerous attachments has been first class. After it stopped recording after circa 20 minutes at the highest resolution on a trial run with the supplied 8GB Card I installed a 32GB Micro SD Card which has worked perfectly. The Video output has been perfect for my needs, as is the continuous camera shot function which automatically shot every 2 seconds giving circa 360 photos per session on track. Only negatives are that the interface is not completely intuitive (i.e. the continuous shooting option resets when the camera is turned off and needs to be selected every time the camera is switched on) but once I realised this was soon grasped. I am completely happy with this purchase.”

“I bought this because I wanted a camera for assorted meetings and recording my day-to-day life and this looked adequate and rugged enough for my sort of life where a Go-Pro was overkill.  It's a nice small light unit, very easy to operate and reasonably discrete. The remote control works with the camera anywhere on your body.

Videos shot are clear and the sound isn't bad either. Still photographs are remarkably clear. 
 
Decent results using cheap class 10 32 GB micro SD cards.”

With a host of features and mounting options including the industry standard KlickFast system, the Veho – Muvi  HD PRO 1080p HD Mini Camcorder has become the most popular body worn camcorder in the market.

                            The Manfrotto MT190XPRO4 4-Section Aluminum Tripod is of excellent build quality with advanced features including its unique 90° center column mechanism which allows the column to be extended both vertically as normal but also horizontally to open up a wide range of framing and shooting possibilities making this tripod extremely versatile and suited to a number of photography and video applications.  Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation is easy and requires no disassembly, just readjust the column as needed.  The 4 section legs help reduce the closed length for the traveling photographer while also allowing greater extended length.  The special design of the Quick Power Lock levers offers more powerful locking of each leg section meaning more stability than traditional designs.  Intuitive leg angle selectors allow each leg to be independently set to any preset angles allowing even more freedom.   The included bubble level in the top center column helps you get precise framing, and it also rotates freely so you can position it anywhere without the mounted head getting in the way when adjusting the tripod.  Additionally the top casting of the 190 has an Easy Link connector for supporting extra photo or video accessories such as flash, reflectors, or other types of equipment onto an extending arm or bracket, making the tripod into a mobile multi-purpose studio.

									The Veho – Muvi  HD PRO 1080p HD Mini Camcorder is designed for professional use, and comes equipped with a Sensa Wireless Remote, 1.5 inch viewing screen and a universal in-car mounting kit. Used by top security companies and personnel around the world, the MUVI™ HD Pro is able to capture the footage that CCTV might miss and has been specially designed for fields such as security, surveillance, military, law enforcement & emergency services, stadium control & safety, evidence collecting and POV Broadcast media.

The MUVI™ camcorder range includes the MUVI™ HD Pro camcorders and a range of body, cycle, motorbike and in car mounting accessories.  The MUVI™ HD10 has full HD 1080p resolution and includes a helmet mounting bracket.
Veho® have also partnered with Peter Jones (ILG) Limited to develop a bespoke MUVI™ HD KlickFast Holder to enable the camcorder to be easily integrated into the existing law enforcement toolset.

The 1400mAh battery has the biggest capacity on the market and will give your Veho – Muvi  HD PRO 1080p HD Mini Camcorder a continuous 3 hours’ recording time. The MUVI™ HD Pro also comes with an 8GB micro SD card which will enable around 80 minutes’ footage at full 1080p @ 16mbit/s and, by reducing resolution, extend record time by even more. 

As well as the rich technical specifications the MUVI™ also comes with a range of sports mounting clips and accessories that enables you to record in almost any situation.

Key Features:
•	5MP 1080p HD video image resolution up to 1920 x 1080
•	Start/Stop/Snapshot Remote control with 160 degree wide angle lens to capture all of the footage all of the time
•	Internal rechargeable lithium battery supporting 4hrs recording and including 8Gb Micro SD card
•	1.5 inch viewfinder/review LCD, Touch panel control, Self-timer, digital zoom, noise activation, slow motion playback, loop record, Car charge and record

Customers have been very happy with their purchases of the Veho – Muvi  HD PRO 1080p HD Mini Camcorder:

“I bought this as I wanted an HD Video for use on a forthcoming motorcycle trackday. Having decided that the Go-Pro was the benchmark, but feeling unable to justify the purchase price as I was unsure how much use the camera would get I opted the Muvi after a lot of desk based research and looking at clips on You Tube and have not been disappointed, the quality of the unit and the numerous attachments has been first class. After it stopped recording after circa 20 minutes at the highest resolution on a trial run with the supplied 8GB Card I installed a 32GB Micro SD Card which has worked perfectly. The Video output has been perfect for my needs, as is the continuous camera shot function which automatically shot every 2 seconds giving circa 360 photos per session on track. Only negatives are that the interface is not completely intuitive (i.e. the continuous shooting option resets when the camera is turned off and needs to be selected every time the camera is switched on) but once I realised this was soon grasped. I am completely happy with this purchase.”

“I bought this because I wanted a camera for assorted meetings and recording my day-to-day life and this looked adequate and rugged enough for my sort of life where a Go-Pro was overkill.  It's a nice small light unit, very easy to operate and reasonably discrete. The remote control works with the camera anywhere on your body.

Videos shot are clear and the sound isn't bad either. Still photographs are remarkably clear. 
 
Decent results using cheap class 10 32 GB micro SD cards.”

With a host of features and mounting options including the industry standard KlickFast system, the Veho – Muvi  HD PRO 1080p HD Mini Camcorder has become the most popular body worn camcorder in the market.

    This video demonstrates PIR-IR60 cameras that are included with this system.


    
    


    Important Note: Click the gear icon in the lower right of the video player and select 720p resolution or 1080p resolution if available so that you can view the video in high definition.




About the Cables


Four sets of 100 foot CCTV camera cables are included with this system. If you need to extend your cable run longer than 100 feet, you should consider upgrading to a RG59 cable spool, connector, and tool kit. This allows you to cut the cable to the exact length that you need.



Hybrid HD Surveillance DVR

	


	The DVR included with this security camera system is an SD / HD hybrid. This means that both traditional analog security cameras and AHD high definition security cameras can be used.


	Here is how it works.


	Originally, CCTV cameras supported D1 resolution which is 704 x 480 pixels.
	Then, 960H CCTV cameras were introduced which support 960 x 480 resolution (a wider format CCTV).
	In 2014, AHD cameras (analog high definition), also known as HD CCTV, was introduced which supports 720p resolution (1280 x 720).
	In 2015, full HD 1080p AHD cameras will be available.
	All of these CCTV video formats work using the same RG59 coax cable to run video from the camera to the DVR. However, the video encoding is different between traditional CCTV (D1 and 960H, also known as standard definition - SD) and AHD.
	This iDVR-E works with both traditional CCTV and AHD cameras. Users can also mix CCTV and AHD cameras on the same recorder (hybrid).
	Important! If both camera types will be used, they need to be grouped in pairs of 2 by type.
	For example, you can have 2 SD cameras on channels 1 and 2, and 2 AHD cameras on channels 3 and 4.
	You can also install SD cameras on all channels or HD cameras on all channels, but again, when you mix technologies, it must be done in groups of two.

You can 
learn more about what AHD is here.

The surface of the tubing is painstakingly machined to create a rough texture to ensure a non-slip surface. The 2-1/2 grip head consists of a pair of rotating aluminum discs attached to a 5/8 (16 mm) receiver. The discs have four different sized V shaped jaws to accept any accessory with a 5/8, 1/2, 3/8 or 1/4 mounting stud or tubing. The V shaped jaws have teeth that grab whatever is mounted between the plates securely. The 2-1/2 grip head features an oversized ergonomic T handle and dedicated roller bearings designed for maximum torque. The grip head uses a non-slip aluminum friction disc that will maintain its durability over time that offers the user positive locking strength and precise control, and is constructed around a solid steel central bolt with a fixed solid pin to secure it to the aluminum casting for increased strength and durability. The 40 grip arm is almost always used in conjunction with a 2 1/2 grip head, giving you complete flexibility to position a gobo go between the light and a subject such as flags, scrims and silks as well as other accessories virtually anywhere.

More shots mean more editing opportunities. Easily record footage from a variety of angles, whether using cameras mounted directly to the FDR-AX33 or triggered wirelessly. Multi Camera Control makes it easy to sync shooting settings on all devices.

 




Live Streaming via Ustream®
From performances to sports events, some things are best seen in real time. Share scenes as they happen with high-quality picture and sound.

 



 


Highlight Movie Maker
A versatile function to streamline movie editing, Highlight Movie Maker offers several time-saving features. Add highlight points to key moments while recording, and let the camcorder automatically sync your transitions to your chosen soundtrack.




Exmor R™ CMOS sensor
This cutting-edge sensor enhances image clarity, reduces noise in dark environments, and enables soft background defocusing.

 




BIONZ X™ image processor
The advanced BIONZ X image processing engine helps achieve more naturally vivid and lifelike image quality as well as faster processing capabilities.

 




Wide-angle ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* lens
This 29.8mm wide-angle ZEISS lens providing 10x optical zoom is not only ideal for capturing grand landscapes, among a range of other scenes — it is fine-tuned specifically for 4K.

 




Exceptional image quality
By employing XAVC S format, which was developed from the XAVC format for professional use, 4K Ultra HD and high-bitrate recording of incredible quality are realised. Yet, XAVC S data is compressed so that it is more manageable for general consumers.

 




20.6MP still image capture
Sometimes you don’t need — or want — video. Put your video camera in still image mode and capture amazing high-quality single images as easily as you do with a still camera.

 




Superb night shooting
This feature uses infrared light to take pictures even in complete darkness. By using NIGHTSHOT, parents can easily capture children’s cute sleeping faces.

 




Motion Shot Video3
This convenient feature allows playback of a dramatic sequence of superimposed images to trace every split second of action, a powerful tool for analysing sports motion on screen. During playback, you can adjust the interval between images, or pause to capture still images to share with friends.

 




Dual Video Recording4
Record two movies at the same time — one in the maximum-quality XAVC S or AVCHD format and another in MP4 format. That way you’ve got a small file ready for instant sharing, plus a professional-grade file for further editing.




Face Detection and Smile Shutter5
Use Face Detection to optimise focus, exposure and colour for people who are the most important subject of a shot. You can prioritise a subject’s face by touching it on the LCD. And with Smile Shutter, the FDR-AX33 can also automatically capture still shots of great (but fleeting) smiles, even while recording movies.




Lock-on AF
Enhances the tracking of moving subjects by using the optimal AF point at all times, and adjusting the target frame size to match your subject’s characteristics. Thanks to advances in phase-detection AF, it’s now more accurate than ever — so lock on and shoot fast-moving targets with precision.

 




5.1ch microphone6
Record clear sound that accurately captures the atmosphere of the scene, and enjoy surround sound playback on your home theatre system. Level meters on the LCD panel provide visual monitoring of each channel’s levels.




Auto Wind Noise Reduction
Using an advanced sound-analysis algorithm, this feature eliminates wind noise — the biggest culprit of bad outdoor audio.




My Voice Cancelling
Reduce the intensity of behind-camera sounds, whether you are talking to or cheering on your subject as you shoot.



Golf Shot
Analyse your swing with no need for fancy equipment. Golf Shot mode lets you capture video and stills of each step of your swing.




Xtra Fine LCD with WhiteMagic™
The high-precision Xtra Fine LCD features a WhiteMagic display that uses white pixels in addition to RGB pixels to boost screen brightness, allowing users to see subtle details and tones on the screen in all types of shooting environments, including outdoors in bright sunlight.




Built-in USB cable
The built-in USB cable stowed in the hand strap is very convenient for extra-quick charging and connection to a PC, so there is no need to pack a bulky extra USB cable or AC adapter. For charging without a PC, use a compact AC-USB adapter (optional).

<br />
New optical design:&nbsp; advanced 5-element/4-group optical design incorporating ultra-high index tanatalum-based optical glass to achieve extraordinary optical performance with improved corner sharpness, distortion and reduced vignetting.<br />
<br />
Like the revolutionary original Metabones Speed Booster announced in January 2013, the Speed Booster ULTRA has a magnification of 0.71x, and so it effectively reduces the crop factor of mirrorless cameras with DX-sized sensors, such as Sony E-mount and Fuji X-mount cameras, from 1.5x to 1.07x.&nbsp; However, the new ULTRA design makes very effective use of exotic materials at the furthest limit of glassmaking technology, and as a result is well corrected for use with virtually all fullframe SLR lenses regardless of exit pupil distance. Thus, the Speed Booster ULTRA performs extremely well with professional-grade f/2.8 zoom lenses such as the 24-70mm f/2.8 and 70-200mm f/2.8 zooms by Canon and Nikon to produce 17-50mm f/2.0 and 50-142mm f/2.0 high-speed zooms, respectively.&nbsp; Similarly, high-speed fixed focal length lenses such as a 50mm f/1.2 will be transformed into a 35.5mm f/0.9 lens with excellent contrast and resolution from the center all the way to the edges of the image. <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sony NEX cameras cannot display aperture values beyond f/1.0. If a f/1.2 Canon EF lens is used with Speed Booster ULTRA the resulting aperture is f/0.9 but the camera body displays the original aperture f/1.2 to the camera body. i.e, lenses slower than f/1.4 report boosted aperture to camera body; lenses at or faster than f/1.4 report original aperture to camera body. (with firmware later than V0.38)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some improperly-made M42 screw mount adapters may short the electronic contacts of the Speed Booster ULTRA and cause damage to the Speed Booster ULTRA and/or camera body.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many manual focus lenses (e.g. OM 28/2.8, OM 50/1.8, Leica R 15/3.5) have rear protrusions (spikes, levers, other appendages) which would damage the optics and/or housing of Speed Booster ULTRA They need to be modified before they can be safely used on Speed Booster Check and make sure there are no rear protrusions from the adapter/lens combination before using on Speed Booster. Scratches and damages caused by rear protrusions on Speed Booster are not covered by warranty.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Speed Booster ULTRA is NOT fully compatible with full-frame Sony A7 series. When Speed Booster&reg; ULTRA is used with Sony A7 series, the camera will turn on the ""APS-C Size Capture"" mode automatically.<br />

This system is a strong, ultra fast and ergonomic locking system that allows for complete extension of the legs with one–hand opening. One of the most innovative aspects of the new 190 is its compactness, which allows for easier portability. The new patented 90° column is accessible when you need it to be, with a quick ‘one finger’ operation. The new 190 allows you to create a portable photographic studio, thanks to the new ""Easy link"" plug, which enables instant connection between tripod and accessories, such as LED lights for Macro Photography and VDSLR applications through arms and brackets.  The new patented Rotating Leveling Bubble is quick to set up and allows you to position the tripod more precisely. It is easy to read, whatever the shape of the head or however the tripod is set up. The new Leg Angle Selectors are also easy to set up, as they are made following the most innovative ergonomic standards and prevent fingers and nails being trapped in the upper casting.

                            Full HD 1080p with Skype video calls
See and be seen in high-definition quality. Logitech partnered with Skype™ to deliver high-definition 1080p resolution with the C920 webcam.*

H.264 AVC compression
Get high-definition (HD) quality video at home or in the office. Real-time HD resolution over typical Internet connection bandwidths requires video compression. C920 webcam uses H.264 encoded compression to provide high quality video at low bit rates

Full HD 1080p recording
Record videos in widescreen Full HD 1080p at 30 frames per second. The same H.264 encoded compression that enables high-definition video calls with Skype, also lets you capture great videos.

HD 720p video call quality
If Skype is not your favorite video-call service, C920 delivers HD 720p calling on most major instant messaging services.

Sharp, rich-color images
Smooth video quality, rich colors and clear sound in real-world environments are produced by Logitech Fluid Crystal™ technology.

Auto focus
C920 uses the same type auto-focus motor used in smartphone cameras. Optimized for webcams, the auto focus gives the sharpest image possible, even as close as 10 cm.

Carl Zeiss optics
To bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar® design into a five-element design. The new design focuses light onto the sensor with maximum detail and minimal distortion.

Stereo audio
A stereo recording or broadcast creates more of a sense of place; it creates a listening environment. Capture video or make a video call knowing that will be heard clearly and naturally.

Stable clip mount
Rubberized bumpers on the clip help hold C920 securely to your monitor or laptop. Also mount it to a tripod

15-megapixel snapshots
Capture brilliant, software-enhanced, 15-megapixel snapshots.

A standard focal length zoom lens, it features a large aperture throughout its focal length. Featuring the latest advances in optical lens design, it utilizes 1 Super UD lens element and 2 UD lens elements that help minimize chromatic aberration in the periphery at wide-angle as well as reduced color blurring around the edges of the subject. In addition, 2 types of aspherical lenses are combined to help reduce spherical aberration over the entire image area as well as through the full zoom range. Optimized lens coatings also help ensure exceptional color balance while minimizing ghosting. The lens is also equipped with a circular 9-blade diaphragm for beautiful, soft backgrounds. A ring-type USM and high-speed CPU with optimized AF algorithms enable silent and fast autofocusing. Built for the rigors of professional use as well as to meet the increased number of shots available with digital photography, it's constructed with improved dust sealing and water resistance while fluorine coatings on the front and rear lens surfaces help reduce soiling, smears and fingerprints. A zoom lock lever locks the zoom position at the wide end for safe transporting while attached to an EOS DSLR camera over the shoulder. 


24-70mm f/2.8L II USM Features:
Large aperture L-series professional ""normal"" zoom lens
New optical design minimizes chromatic aberration on the outer area at wide-angle
Uses 2 types of aspherical lenses to achieve high image quality throughout the full zoom range

<br />
<br />
Contrary to the popular trend of other factories using an aluminum ring painted black on the camera-body-side, we instead take no short-cut but use precision-machined brass with chromium plating on both the camera-body and the lens sides of our adapters, in order to ensure smooth mounting, great appearance, and durability. The lens side of the adapter features a strong leaf-spring structure, strengthening the adapter-lens connection and ensuring tightness of the lens in order to reduce wear and prevent focus errors and optical alignment issues from appearing.
<br />
<br />
Metabones uses matte-black treatment to keep internal reflection to a minimum in order to maintain the maximum optical quality possible with the lens.
<br />
<br />
All Metabones Adapters follow this tradition of uncompromising precision, robust build quality and outstanding finish. Our new Smart AdapterTM series of products add industry-leading electronic interfacing technology from Canada, with true electronic control of the lens' aperture directly from the camera body.<br />

<strong>
Always Enhance and Never Degrade the Performance of the Attached Master Lens
</strong><br />
<br />
Like the ULTRA series for Sony E-mount, the new Speed Booster ULTRA m43 uses an advanced 5-element 4-group optical design incorporating ultra-high index tantalum-based optical glass.  However, the new design is specifically optimized for the Micro Four Thirds sensor and filter stack, and as a result achieves an astonishing level of performance that sets a new standard for focal reducers.
<br />
<br />
Like the revolutionary original Metabones Speed Booster&reg; announced in January 2013, the Speed Booster ULTRA m43 has a magnification of 0.71x, and so it effectively reduces the crop factor of mirrorless Micro Four Thirds mount cameras from 2.0x to 1.4x.  However, the new ULTRA design makes very effective use of exotic materials at the furthest limit of glassmaking technology, and as a result is almost perfectly corrected for use with all fullframe SLR lenses regardless of aperture.  The Speed Booster ULTRA m43 will also work extremely well with many DX and APS-C format lenses provided the image circle of the lens is large enough.  Optical performance of the new Speed Boosters is so good that the MTF of any lens attached to it will be improved.  Even the latest generation of ultra-high performance SLR lenses such as the Zeiss Otus series can be improved by adding a Speed Booster ULTRA m43. <br />
<br />
<strong>Autofocus with an Optimum Balance of Accuracy, Speed, Consistency and Reliability
</strong><br />
<br />
New in Speed Booster ULTRA for Canon EF Mount to Micro Four Thirds is autofocus support, subject to certain limitations (see table above for details). We are pleased to report that Panasonic Micro Four Thirds camera bodies are capable of autofocusing accurately even if the maximum aperture of the Speed Booster and the lens combined is in the sub-f/1.0 range. Although our first and foremost priority is accuracy, we are able to make great strides in autofocus speed as well.

<strong>Manual Focus Lens Compatibility
</strong><br />
<br />
Some improperly-made M42 screw mount adapters may short the electronic contacts of the Speed Booster and cause damage to the Speed Booster and/or camera body.
<br />
<br />
Focus confirmation ""chips"" such as Dandelion are incompatible.
<br />
<br />
Many manual focus lenses (e.g. OM 28/2.8, OM 50/1.8, Leica R 15/3.5) have rear protrusions (spikes, levers, other appendages) which would damage the optics and/or housing of Speed Booster. They need to be modified before they can be safely used on Speed Booster. Check and make sure there are no rear protrusions from the adapter/lens combination before using on Speed Booster. Scratches and damages caused by rear protrusions on Speed Booster are not covered by warranty.<br />

                            18-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor & DIGIC 4+
The APS-C CMOS sensor, which is approx. 25 times bigger than the 1/3.2-inch type sensor used in many smartphones results in photos with more clarity than before. Capture the lovely colour gradations in sunset and intricate details in clouds in true-to-life detail. Clear photos with little noise is possible even in indoor and low-light environments thanks to the DIGIC 4+ image processor, which allows you to experience the joys of the high image quality with ISO speed up to a maximum of 12,800.

Wide range of lens options for greater versatility
The EOS 1300D can be used with over 70 EF/EF-S lenses. Within this range, you will find zoom lenses convenient for travel, macro lenses that allow close-ups of tiny insects and lenses equipped with the image stabilizer (IS), among others. There are also wide-angle lenses that enable you to capture a wide expanse of landscape within one shot, mid-telephotos that are ideal for human portraits, and telephotos that allow you to capture the expressions of wild animals far away. High quality, beautiful shots—regardless of subject. With the EOS 1300D, you can make your imagination come to life.

Wi-Fi / NFC—Capture images remotely and share them on social media!
The EOS 1300D is both Wi-Fi and NFC-ready. You can connect it to other NFC-ready devices just by putting them close together—perfectly convenient for uploading quality images for sharing on social media. With the Camera Connect app, adjusting of camera settings and capturing images remotely is now possible. EOS 1300D is also compatible with the Connect Station CS100 photo storage device, allowing you to view those photos together with your family and friends on a TV screen at your next gathering!

The surface of the tubing is painstakingly machined to create a rough texture to ensure a non-slip surface. The 2-1/2 grip head consists of a pair of rotating aluminum discs attached to a 5/8 (16 mm) receiver. The discs have four different sized V shaped jaws to accept any accessory with a 5/8, 1/2, 3/8 or 1/4 mounting stud or tubing. The V shaped jaws have teeth that grab whatever is mounted between the plates securely. The 2-1/2 grip head features an oversized ergonomic T handle and dedicated roller bearings designed for maximum torque. The grip head uses a non-slip aluminum friction disc that will maintain its durability over time that offers the user positive locking strength and precise control, and is constructed around a solid steel central bolt with a fixed solid pin to secure it to the aluminum casting for increased strength and durability. The 40 grip arm is almost always used in conjunction with a 2 1/2 grip head, giving you complete flexibility to position gobo go between the light and a subject such as flags, scrims and silks as well as other accessories virtually anywhere.""

The extender is perfect for photojournalists, nature and sports photographers who need to get close to distant and challenging subjects. The Extender EF 2x III increases the focal length of a lens by a factor of 2x while still delivering superb image quality. To ensure the best possible image quality in all shooting conditions, it also combines enhanced environmental protection, redesigned optics and improved data communication between lens and camera.</p>
<p>The extender allows professional photographers to shoot distant subjects without having to carry a number of heavy lenses. The Extender EF 2x III features five groups of nine elements, ensuring improved optical performance. All optical elements use Canon's Super Spectra coating, reducing ghosting and flare to minimize post-processing requirements. A new Fluorine Coating on the front and rear elements makes marks, such as spots left by water or fingerprints, much easier to clean than standard coatings.</p>""@en ",,

                            The Manfrotto MT190XPRO4 4-Section Aluminum Tripod is of excellent build quality with advanced features including its unique 90° center column mechanism which allows the column to be extended both vertically as normal but also horizontally to open up a wide range of framing and shooting possibilities making this tripod extremely versatile and suited to a number of photography and video applications.  Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation is easy and requires no disassembly, just readjust the column as needed.  The 4 section legs help reduce the closed length for the traveling photographer while also allowing greater extended length.  The special design of the Quick Power Lock levers offers more powerful locking of each leg section meaning more stability than traditional designs.  Intuitive leg angle selectors allow each leg to be independently set to any preset angles allowing even more freedom.   The included bubble level in the top center column helps you get precise framing, and it also rotates freely so you can position it anywhere without the mounted head getting in the way when adjusting the tripod.  Additionally the top casting of the 190 has an Easy Link connector for supporting extra photo or video accessories such as flash, reflectors, or other types of equipment onto an extending arm or bracket, making the tripod into a mobile multi-purpose studio.

A standard focal length zoom lens, it features a large aperture throughout its focal length. Featuring the latest advances in optical lens design, it utilizes 1 Super UD lens element and 2 UD lens elements that help minimize chromatic aberration in the periphery at wide-angle as well as reduced color blurring around the edges of the subject. In addition, 2 types of aspherical lenses are combined to help reduce spherical aberration over the entire image area as well as through the full zoom range. Optimized lens coatings also help ensure exceptional color balance while minimizing ghosting. The lens is also equipped with a circular 9-blade diaphragm for beautiful, soft backgrounds. A ring-type USM and high-speed CPU with optimized AF algorithms enable silent and fast autofocusing. Built for the rigors of professional use as well as to meet the increased number of shots available with digital photography, it's constructed with improved dust sealing and water resistance while fluorine coatings on the front and rear lens surfaces help reduce soiling, smears and fingerprints. A zoom lock lever locks the zoom position at the wide end for safe transporting while attached to an EOS DSLR camera over the shoulder.

Large aperture L-series professional ""normal"" zoom lens
New optical design minimizes chromatic aberration on the outer area at wide-angle
Uses 2 types of aspherical lenses to achieve high image quality throughout the full zoom range

The 2-1/2 grip head consists of a pair of rotating aluminum discs attached to a 5/8 (16 mm) receiver. The discs have four different sized V shaped jaws to accept any accessory with a 5/8, 1/2, 3/8 or 1/4 mounting stud or tubing. The V shaped jaws have teeth that grab whatever is mounted between the plates securely. The 2-1/2 grip head features an oversized ergonomic T handle and dedicated roller bearings designed for maximum torque. The grip head uses a non-slip aluminum friction disc that will maintain its durability over time that offers the user positive locking strength and precise control, and is constructed around a solid steel central bolt with a fixed solid pin to secure it to the aluminum casting for increased strength and durability. The 40 grip arm is almost always used in conjunction with a 2 1/2 grip head, giving you complete flexibility to position gobo go between the light and a subject such as flags, scrims and silks as well as other accessories virtually anywhere.""@en-US ",,

Plongez au coeur des détails, vivez des instants mémorables.


La nature ne laisse pas de place aux temps morts. Un constat qui s’applique chez Carl Zeiss. Les nouveaux modèles CONQUEST HD en sont la concrétisation. Une révolution en matière de Design, d‘ergonomie et d‘optique. La quintessence de la polyvalence „Made in Germany“, qui unit la qualité traditionnelle ZEISS et la technologie de dernière génération. Tout ceci avec un rapport qualité-prix remarquable. L’ensemble de ces caractéristiques permet aux modèles de jumelles Zeiss CONQUEST HD d’être considérés comme étant la meilleure façon de découvrir les produits haut de gamme ZEISS, sans le moindre compromis. 

Grâce au nouveau bloc de lentilles HD, les modèles CONQUEST HD peuvent déployer tous leurs talents en matière de qualité d’image et de fidélité chromatique. Le champ de vision particulièrement large qui permet de découvrir la nature sous un autre angle en est un bon exemple, ainsi que le traitement LotuTec® qui garantit une excellente visibilité par tous les temps et facilite le nettoyage.
Le traitement multi-couches Carl Zeiss T* dont bénéficient les modèles CONQUEST HD permet de profiter, grâce à sa transmission de plus de 90%, d’observations crépusculaires de bonne qualité.

Robustes, compacts et légers, les modèles CONQUEST HD sont particulièrement discrets en termes d’encombrement, mais se font d’autant plus remarquer en termes de qualité d’image. Le nouveau Design est toutefois incomparable, tandis que l’ergonomie et la maniabilité assurent une mise au point précise même avec des gants.

        Canon EW-75II Lens Hood for 20mm and 20-35mm
When sunlight or other light rays enter, through a certain angle, your lens, lens flare arises. This results in unwanted blemishes in your photos. By using a lens hood you prevents this effect. Furthermore, the lens hood functions as an additional protection for your lens. A lens hood is an essential accessory for every photographer.
The Canon EW-75II is suitable for:
- EF 20mm F2.8 USM
- EF 20-35mm F3.5-4.5 USM

                        This Sigma 12-24mm F4.5-5.6 lens has a large variable angle of view from 122° super wide-angle (at 12mm/diagonal axis) to 84.1°. The 4 Special Low Dispersion (SLD) glass elements enable effective compensation of color aberration, which is a common problem with super-wide angle lenses.
Features an inner focusing system that keeps the length of the lens unchanged while controlling aberration; a minimum focusing distance of 11"" at all focal lengths; and it's equipped with a Petal-type hood to block out extraneous light.
Please Note: This lens is designed for Nikon Digital Lens mount.

Building on the popularity and versatility of broad focal range lenses, the new NIKKOR AF-S 28-300mm VR II is Nikon’s first FX-format lens with a 10.7x zoom range ideal for enthusiasts and professionals. The AF-S 28-300mm VR II is the all-in-one optical solution that is ideal for capturing landscapes, portraits and distant subjects. This lens is optimized for edge-to-edge sharpness on both FX and DX-format digital SLR cameras, and has an equivalent focal length of 42-450mm when attached to a DX-format digital SLR. Its optical formula includes two ED glass elements that effectively minimize chromatic aberration, even at the widest aperture settings, as well as three Aspherical Lens Elements that virtually eliminate coma and other aberrations at wide aperture settings. This high performance lens also incorporates an M/A Focus Mode Switch that enables quick changes between manual and autofocus operation, and Internal Focus (IF) providing fast and quiet autofocus without changing the length of the lens while retaining working distance through the focus range.

Thick carbon-fiber plate construction with robust aluminum support makes this fully assembled racer lightweight and incredibly durable. In the event of a mishap, replacement of the self-tightening propellers is all youï¿½ll likely need. Brilliant LED lighting helps with orientation and identification in the heat of a race. Powerful motors that are canted forward help give you the performance edge while the protected ultra micro FPV camera is soft mounted for the best view. The streamlined body combines improved aerodynamics with an additional level of protection that makes your Mach 25 machine stand out from the pack. Exclusive SAFE (Sensor Assisted Flight Envelope) technology built into the Spektrum A3174 flight controller is a revolutionary electronic flight envelope protection system that makes it easy to stay in control. Multiple flight modes with increasing levels of agility are provided and just a transmitter switch away. From maximum assistance with self-leveling and envelope limitations to full-range aerobatic agility, SAFE technology gives you the ability to get up to speed at your own pace. Bind-N-Fly Completion Now itï¿½s possible to start enjoying high-performance racing virtually the moment you open the box. Just charge the battery, bind the model to your DSMX technology compatible transmitter and fly. FPV Ready The installed Spektrum ultra micro, 25mW airborne FPV camera system is mounted to a damped carbon-fiber plate and features excellent range for approved AMA line-of-sight FPV flying. All you need to enjoy the view is a Fat Shark compatible headset or 5.8GHz video monitor. Carbon-Fiber Frame Durable, 2.0mm thick, carbon-fiber frame plates surround vital electronics and connect with tough CNC-machined aluminum supports that hold the aluminum motor booms. Canted Motor Mounts For quicker acceleration and faster forward flight the four brushless motors are mounted at a forward angle. Its lower flight angle also improves your visibility through the camera. Self-Tightening Propellers No tools are required to change out broken props. The self-tightening hubs make changing props quick so that you can get back to racing quicker. The other benefit of the hub design is that it makes the cost of propeller replacement much lower. Integrated LED Lighting Brilliant LED lighting in each motor boom helps with your visual orientation and makes it possible to locate your opponent more quickly. Streamlined Body To improve aerodynamics and add a level of protection against the elements is a durable body thatï¿½s been custom designed by Mirco Pecorari of Aircraft Studio Design.RequiresA full-range 5+ channel, multi-function transmitter with Spektrum 2.4GHz DSM2/DSMX technology A Fat Shark 5.8GHz compatible FPV headset and/or FPV monitor A suitable Li-Po flight battery charger""@en ",,

<br />
It promises real innovation in the field of HDSLR filming by circumventing the need for any physical contact with the camera and lens for focus and other film/photo operations, instead wiring directly into the camera body to use the internal systems to electronically control focus and advanced camera operations and settings. <br />
<br />
The advantages are obvious: lenses can be swapped easily without extra hardware or adjustment, nothing jolts the camera unexpectedly during focus, one-man camera operation is easier and safer, and control at a distance is as simple as extending the cable between the camera and the remote. <br />
<br />
The Deluxe Remote's functions are as follows: <br />
<br />
- 3-step, ultra-precise focus speed <br />
- Fixed or variable focus control modes<br />
- Customizable focus speed limit <br />
- Focus Memory settings <br />
- Live View control <br />
- Auto Focus control and Auto Focus point selection <br />
- Live View Digital Zoom control <br />
- Video recording start/stop <br />
- Photo shutter release <br />
- Remote control and camera battery status <br />
- Customizable focus direction <br />
- ISO - Shutter speed <br />
- Aperture <br />
- Colour temperature <br />
- Exposure level<br />
<br />
The LCD screen on the Deluxe Remote relays general information from the camera, such as battery charge level, white balance temperature and memory card status &ndash; especially useful if the camera&rsquo;s on-body screen is inaccessible: <br />
- L1. CAMERA MODE DIAL <br />
- L2. EXPOSURE LEVEL INDICATOR <br />
- L3. CAMERA BATTERY CHECK <br />
- L4. CAMERA MODE <br />
- L5. VIDEO MODE <br />
- L6. REMOTE CONTROL BATTERY CHECK <br />
- L7. APERTURE INDICATOR <br />
- L8. SHUTTER SPEED <br />
- L9. COLOR TEMPERATURE INDICATOR <br />
- L10. ISO INDICATOR . <br />
<br />
The Deluxe Remote Control is ideal for use as one of the hand grips of a SYMPLA rig, where it means that a single camera operator can properly support the weight of the camera and rig to ensure smooth, accurate framing and movement, while also controlling all camera functions, without removing either hand from the rig.<br />
<br />
The Deluxe version can also be used hand-held and away from the camera and its support, it can be attached to video head pan bars or set up in any number of alternative configurations.<br />

The inside of the battery now uses a larger number of smaller cells and so the battery capacity has increased from 2300mAh to 2450mAh. The Canon LP-E4N is suitable for previous EOS-1 series cameras and the older Canon LP-E4 is also compatible with the new Canon EOS 1D X. The Canon LP-E4N battery should only be used with the new Canon LC-E4N battery charger, however the older LP-E4 batteries can be charged in the new battery charger (Canon LC-E4N) with no problems.

MVH500AH
 


La MVH500AH est une rotule légère dotée d'une platine plus large pour fixer des boîtiers HDSLR et d’un plateau coulissant permettant d'équilibrer les appareils à optiques interchangeables les plus récents. 

La 500 assure des prises de vue plus fluides avec un meilleur contrôle, et peut supporter du matériel jusqu'à 5 kg.
Il s’agit de la rotule vidéo la plus compacte de la gamme à succès Bridging Technology™, elle remplace la rotule vidéo Mafrotto 701HDV.
 

Des clichés d’une belle fluidité :

La 500 est équipée de cartouches fluides sur les axes 'panoramique' et 'bascule', de façon à garantir fluidité, maîtrise et précision à chaque mouvement de l'appareil.


Une utilisation plus rapide, plus facile et plus sûre : 

le système de verrouillage latéral permet de retirer l’appareil de la rotule par le dessus, plus facilement et plus rapidement. Aucun verrouillage de sécurité supplémentaire n’est nécessaire.

La 500 possède un système de contre-balancement préréglé de 2,4 kg, mais elle supporte du matériel pouvant peser jusqu'à 5 kg.
La 500 dispose d'un connecteur Easy Link 3/8” qui permet l'installation d'un moniteur externe ou d'autres équipements accessoires. 


La rotule MVH500AH peut s’associer à un trépied dédié aux appareils hybrides, à un trépied photo traditionnel, à un monopode ou à d’autres supports.

Plongez au coeur des détails, vivez des instants mémorables.


La nature ne laisse pas de place aux temps morts. Un constat qui s’applique chez Carl Zeiss. Les nouveaux modèles CONQUEST HD en sont la concrétisation. Une révolution en matière de Design, d‘ergonomie et d‘optique. La quintessence de la polyvalence „Made in Germany“, qui unit la qualité traditionnelle ZEISS et la technologie de dernière génération. Tout ceci avec un rapport qualité-prix remarquable. L’ensemble de ces caractéristiques permet aux modèles de jumelles Zeiss CONQUEST HD d’être considérés comme étant la meilleure façon de découvrir les produits haut de gamme ZEISS, sans le moindre compromis. 

Grâce au nouveau bloc de lentilles HD, les modèles Conquest HD peuvent déployer tous leurs talents en matière de qualité d’image et de fidélité chromatique. Le champ de vision particulièrement large qui permet de découvrir la nature sous un autre angle en est un bon exemple, ainsi que le traitement LotuTec® qui garantit une excellente visibilité par tous les temps et facilite le nettoyage.
Le traitement multi-couches Carl Zeiss T* dont bénéficient les modèles Conquest HD permet de profiter, grâce à sa transmission de plus de 90%, d’observations crépusculaires de bonne qualité.

Robustes, compacts et légers, les modèles Conquest HD sont particulièrement discrets en termes d’encombrement, mais se font d’autant plus remarquer en termes de qualité d’image. Le nouveau Design est toutefois incomparable, tandis que l’ergonomie et la maniabilité assurent une mise au point précise même avec des gants.

Photographers often have a bag with the ideal combination of features, but that is either too small or too large for their needs. Billingham has therefore introduced the Billingham 335.

Plongez au coeur des détails, vivez des instants mémorables.


La nature ne laisse pas de place aux temps morts. Un constat qui s’applique chez Carl Zeiss. Les nouveaux modèles CONQUEST HD en sont la concrétisation. Une révolution en matière de Design, d‘ergonomie et d‘optique. La quintessence de la polyvalence „Made in Germany“, qui unit la qualité traditionnelle ZEISS et la technologie de dernière génération. Tout ceci avec un rapport qualité-prix remarquable. L’ensemble de ces caractéristiques permet aux modèles de jumelles Zeiss CONQUEST HD d’être considérés comme étant la meilleure façon de découvrir les produits haut de gamme ZEISS, sans le moindre compromis. 

Grâce au nouveau bloc de lentilles HD, les modèles Conquest HD peuvent déployer tous leurs talents en matière de qualité d’image et de fidélité chromatique. Le champ de vision particulièrement large qui permet de découvrir la nature sous un autre angle en est un bon exemple, ainsi que le traitement LotuTec® qui garantit une excellente visibilité par tous les temps et facilite le nettoyage.
Le traitement multi-couches Carl Zeiss T* dont bénéficient les modèles Conquest HD permet de profiter, grâce à sa transmission de plus de 90%, d’observations crépusculaires de bonne qualité.

Robustes, compacts et légers, les modèles Conquest HD sont particulièrement discrets en termes d’encombrement, mais se font d’autant plus remarquer en termes de qualité d’image. Le nouveau Design est toutefois incomparable, tandis que l’ergonomie et la maniabilité assurent une mise au point précise même avec des gants.

The surface of the tubing is painstakingly machined to create a rough texture to ensure a non-slip surface. The 2-1/2 grip head consists of a pair of rotating aluminum discs attached to a 5/8 (16 mm) receiver. The discs have four different sized V shaped jaws to accept any accessory with a 5/8, 1/2, 3/8 or 1/4 mounting stud or tubing. The V shaped jaws have teeth that grab whatever is mounted between the plates securely. The 2-1/2 grip head features an oversized ergonomic T handle and dedicated roller bearings designed for maximum torque. The grip head uses a non-slip aluminum friction disc that will maintain its durability over time that offers the user positive locking strength and precise control, and is constructed around a solid steel central bolt with a fixed solid pin to secure it to the aluminum casting for increased strength and durability. The 40 grip arm is almost always used in conjunction with a 2 1/2 grip head, giving you complete flexibility to position a gobo go between the light and a subject such as flags, scrims and silks as well as other accessories virtually anywhere. This stand is clad in a stealthy black powder coated finish.""@en-US ",,

Its equivalent focal length in FX-format is 82.5-450mm. This lens is an excellent choice for travel, landscapes, portraits, and distant subjects. The lens focuses to 4.6' at every focal length - this versatility ensures stunning close-up shots of subjects near and far.</p>
<p>The VR II image stabilization allows you to handhold the your camera at up to 4 shutter speeds slower than would otherwise be possible, assuring dramatically sharper still images and stable video capture. Other features include the silent wave motor for quiet accurate autofocusing, and a rounded 9-blade diaphragm that offers stunning out-of-focus highlights (bokeh). The lens elements have been treated with Nikon's Super Integrated Coating - an optical lens coating process that maximizes light transmission while enhancing clarity and contrast. All of these world-class features add up to the AF-S 55-300 being an ideal lens for traveling or shooting close to home.</p>""@en ",,

The processor also provides notable speed throughout the camera system, including the ability to record up to 7 fps in full-resolution, quickened AF speeds, and full HD 1080p video recording. The 3.0-inch Clear View II touchscreen LCD monitor profits greatly from the advent Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and its ability to utilize Touch AF focusing for finely controlled selection of the point of focus.

After it stopped recording after circa 20 minutes at the highest resolution on a trial run with the supplied 4GB Card I installed a 32GB Micro SD Card which has worked perfectly.”

5-axis SteadyShot. Internal image stabilization on the a7RII compensates for blur and camera shake from five different directions as opposed to two in previous systems. You can view the effects of this stabilization on your LCD when in movie mode.

4K Internal Recording. The Sony a7RII it the first DSLM to offer 4K, full-frame recording to internal media.

La mise au point peut être effectuée manuellement à tout moment, ce qui permet de l'ajuster sans changer de mode autofocus. Enfin, un diaphragme circulaire à 9 lamelles permet un flou d'arrière-plan magnifique, idéal pour les portraits.

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO3-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 3-section aluminium tripod with a 90° centre column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 pl plate.

No secondary safety lock is necessary. The side lock system also makes it quicker and simpler to lift the camera out of the head from above.

<br />
<br />
Contrary to the popular trend of other factories using an aluminum ring painted black on the camera-body-side, we instead take no short-cut but use precision-machined brass with chromium plating on both the camera-body and the lens sides of our adapters, in order to ensure smooth mounting, great appearance, and durability. The lens side of the adapter features a strong leaf-spring structure, strengthening the adapter-lens connection and ensuring tightness of the lens in order to reduce wear and prevent focus errors and optical alignment issues from appearing.
<br />
<br />
Metabones uses matte-black treatment to keep internal reflection to a minimum in order to maintain the maximum optical quality possible with the lens.
<br />
<br />
All Metabones Adapters follow this tradition of uncompromising precision, robust build quality and outstanding finish. Our new Smart AdapterTM series of products add industry-leading electronic interfacing technology from Canada, with true electronic control of the lens' aperture directly from the camera body.<br />

<strong>
Always Enhance and Never Degrade the Performance of the Attached Master Lens
</strong><br />
<br />
Like the ULTRA series for Sony E-mount, the new Speed Booster ULTRA m43 uses an advanced 5-element 4-group optical design incorporating ultra-high index tantalum-based optical glass.  However, the new design is specifically optimized for the Micro Four Thirds sensor and filter stack, and as a result achieves an astonishing level of performance that sets a new standard for focal reducers.
<br />
<br />
Like the revolutionary original Metabones Speed Booster&reg; announced in January 2013, the Speed Booster ULTRA m43 has a magnification of 0.71x, and so it effectively reduces the crop factor of mirrorless Micro Four Thirds mount cameras from 2.0x to 1.4x.  However, the new ULTRA design makes very effective use of exotic materials at the furthest limit of glassmaking technology, and as a result is almost perfectly corrected for use with all fullframe SLR lenses regardless of aperture.  The Speed Booster ULTRA m43 will also work extremely well with many DX and APS-C format lenses provided the image circle of the lens is large enough.  Optical performance of the new Speed Boosters is so good that the MTF of any lens attached to it will be improved.  Even the latest generation of ultra-high performance SLR lenses such as the Zeiss Otus series can be improved by adding a Speed Booster ULTRA m43. <br />
<br />
<strong>Autofocus with an Optimum Balance of Accuracy, Speed, Consistency and Reliability
</strong><br />
<br />
New in Speed Booster ULTRA for Canon EF Mount to Micro Four Thirds is autofocus support, subject to certain limitations (see table above for details). We are pleased to report that Panasonic Micro Four Thirds camera bodies are capable of autofocusing accurately even if the maximum aperture of the Speed Booster and the lens combined is in the sub-f/1.0 range. Although our first and foremost priority is accuracy, we are able to make great strides in autofocus speed as well.

<strong>Manual Focus Lens Compatibility
</strong><br />
<br />
Some improperly-made M42 screw mount adapters may short the electronic contacts of the Speed Booster and cause damage to the Speed Booster and/or camera body.
<br />
<br />
Focus confirmation ""chips"" such as Dandelion are incompatible.
<br />
<br />
Many manual focus lenses (e.g. OM 28/2.8, OM 50/1.8, Leica R 15/3.5) have rear protrusions (spikes, levers, other appendages) which would damage the optics and/or housing of Speed Booster. They need to be modified before they can be safely used on Speed Booster. Check and make sure there are no rear protrusions from the adapter/lens combination before using on Speed Booster. Scratches and damages caused by rear protrusions on Speed Booster are not covered by warranty.<br />

        The Canon TC-80N3 remote lets you control the shutter of your Canon EOS, from a maximum distance of 0.8 meters. Besides ease of use the cable remote also prevents camera shake because you do not have to touch the camera when taking a picture. This is especially important when using slow shutter speeds so you can help to avoid blurry images.
The TC-80N3 can be used to time accurately exposures from 1 second to 99 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds.

La MVH500AH est une rotule légère dotée d'une platine plus large pour fixer des boîtiers HDSLR et d’un plateau coulissant permettant d'équilibrer les appareils à optiques interchangeables les plus récents. 

La 500 assure des prises de vue plus fluides avec un meilleur contrôle, et peut supporter du matériel jusqu'à 5 kg.
Il s’agit de la rotule vidéo la plus compacte de la gamme à succès Bridging Technology™, elle remplace la rotule vidéo Mafrotto 701HDV.
 

Des clichés d’une belle fluidité :

La 500 est équipée de cartouches fluides sur les axes 'panoramique' et 'bascule', de façon à garantir fluidité, maîtrise et précision à chaque mouvement de l'appareil.


Une utilisation plus rapide, plus facile et plus sûre : 

le système de verrouillage latéral permet de retirer l’appareil de la rotule par le dessus, plus facilement et plus rapidement. Aucun verrouillage de sécurité supplémentaire n’est nécessaire.

La 500 possède un système de contre-balancement préréglé de 2,4 kg, mais elle supporte du matériel pouvant peser jusqu'à 5 kg.
La 500 dispose d'un connecteur Easy Link 3/8” qui permet l'installation d'un moniteur externe ou d'autres équipements accessoires. 


La rotule MVH500AH peut s’associer à un trépied dédié aux appareils hybrides, à un trépied photo traditionnel, à un monopode ou à d’autres supports.
