                            Full HD 1080p with Skype video calls
See and be seen in high-definition quality. Logitech partnered with Skype™ to deliver high-definition 1080p resolution with the C920 webcam.*

H.264 AVC compression
Get high-definition (HD) quality video at home or in the office. Real-time HD resolution over typical Internet connection bandwidths requires video compression. C920 webcam uses H.264 encoded compression to provide high quality video at low bit rates

Full HD 1080p recording
Record videos in widescreen Full HD 1080p at 30 frames per second. The same H.264 encoded compression that enables high-definition video calls with Skype, also lets you capture great videos.

HD 720p video call quality
If Skype is not your favorite video-call service, C920 delivers HD 720p calling on most major instant messaging services.

Sharp, rich-color images
Smooth video quality, rich colors and clear sound in real-world environments are produced by Logitech Fluid Crystal™ technology.

Auto focus
C920 uses the same type auto-focus motor used in smartphone cameras. Optimized for webcams, the auto focus gives the sharpest image possible, even as close as 10 cm.

Carl Zeiss optics
To bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar® design into a five-element design. The new design focuses light onto the sensor with maximum detail and minimal distortion.

Stereo audio
A stereo recording or broadcast creates more of a sense of place; it creates a listening environment. Capture video or make a video call knowing that will be heard clearly and naturally.

Stable clip mount
Rubberized bumpers on the clip help hold C920 securely to your monitor or laptop. Also mount it to a tripod

15-megapixel snapshots
Capture brilliant, software-enhanced, 15-megapixel snapshots.

                                    Details
    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

It has a load capacity of 19.8 lb and extends from 3.5"" to 66.9"". Its carbon fiber legs are secured by the Quick Power Locks. These updated flip locks increase the tripod's rigidity by 50% compared to its predecessor.  A redesigned center column has a ""one finger"" operation, and includes an Easy Link 3/8""-16 attachment for attaching accessories such as an LED light or a reflector via a compatibhttps://www.optics4birding.com/media/images/products/152974-1.jpgle arm. The center column can be positioned horizontally, allowing for low-angle and macro photography. The upper disc where a tripod head is mounted has been redesigned as well, and now has a bull's eye bubble level that rotates 360° so you can locate it where you can see it. This allows you to level your camera on both the horizontal and vertical planes.

                            Full HD 1080p with Skype video calls
See and be seen in high-definition quality. Logitech partnered with Skype™ to deliver high-definition 1080p resolution with the C920 webcam.*

H.264 AVC compression
Get high-definition (HD) quality video at home or in the office. Real-time HD resolution over typical Internet connection bandwidths requires video compression. C920 webcam uses H.264 encoded compression to provide high quality video at low bit rates

Full HD 1080p recording
Record videos in widescreen Full HD 1080p at 30 frames per second. The same H.264 encoded compression that enables high-definition video calls with Skype, also lets you capture great videos.

HD 720p video call quality
If Skype is not your favorite video-call service, C920 delivers HD 720p calling on most major instant messaging services.

Sharp, rich-color images
Smooth video quality, rich colors and clear sound in real-world environments are produced by Logitech Fluid Crystal™ technology.

Auto focus
C920 uses the same type auto-focus motor used in smartphone cameras. Optimized for webcams, the auto focus gives the sharpest image possible, even as close as 10 cm.

Carl Zeiss optics
To bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar® design into a five-element design. The new design focuses light onto the sensor with maximum detail and minimal distortion.

Stereo audio
A stereo recording or broadcast creates more of a sense of place; it creates a listening environment. Capture video or make a video call knowing that will be heard clearly and naturally.

Stable clip mount
Rubberized bumpers on the clip help hold C920 securely to your monitor or laptop. Also mount it to a tripod

15-megapixel snapshots
Capture brilliant, software-enhanced, 15-megapixel snapshots.

    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

The image stabilizer effect is equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon's 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second.

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

The advantages are obvious: lenses can be swapped easily without extra hardware or adjustment, nothing jolts the camera unexpectedly during follow-focus, one-man camera operation is easier, and control at a distance is as simple as extending the cable between the camera and the remote. The Clamp-On Remote is perfectly integrated into the SYMPLA system, fitting comfortably to the spacer element of a SYMPLA Adjustable Handle and allowing fingertip control of key camera functions without moving the hand from the grips, in turn making support more stable and secure.

                                    Details
    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

It is designed with Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology and is compact and light. This high zoom ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). The image stabilizer effect is equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon's 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second. It also uses a UD-glass lens element to correct chromatic aberration for excellent image quality throughout the zoom range. Filter Size - 58mm Max.

This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

                                    Details
    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

35mm Exmor R CMOS Sensor. The world's first full-frame sensor with back-illuminated structure, the Exmor R combines gapless on-chip lens design and anti-reflective coating on the surface of the sensor's glass seal to dramatically improve light collection efficiency. By switching to copper in the wiring layer, the transmission speed has increased â trumping this camera's predecessor, the a7R. The results? 42.4 Megapixel stills and 4K video with high sensitivity - up to ISO 102,4003.

5-axis SteadyShot. Internal image stabilization on the a7RII compensates for blur and camera shake from five different directions as opposed to two in previous systems. You can view the effects of this stabilization on your LCD when in movie mode.

4K Internal Recording. The Sony a7RII it the first DSLM to offer 4K, full-frame recording to internal media.

Made from water-repellent Cordura nylon, this Pro bag features a multi-layered construction and a front shield that, along with four shock-absorbing feet, better diverts impact away from the middle of the bag. For further impact protection, the Pro bag features red rigid padded interior dividers that are built to withstand impact within the middle of the bag and maintain the interior shape.  For convenience when traveling, there is a nylon-webbed trolley strap at the back. For carrying the bag, there is a detachable adjustable shoulder harness with an included waist belt and sternum strap, and a grab handle at the top. Additionally, a removable rain cover is included for inclement weather.

It is designed with Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology and is compact and light. This high zoom ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). The image stabilizer effect is equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon's 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second.

                            The official marketing text of Logitech C920 15MP 1920 x 1080pixels USB 2.0 Black webcam as supplied by the manufacturer

                            Full HD 1080p with Skype video calls
See and be seen in high-definition quality. Logitech partnered with Skype™ to deliver high-definition 1080p resolution with the C920 webcam.*

H.264 AVC compression
Get high-definition (HD) quality video at home or in the office. Real-time HD resolution over typical Internet connection bandwidths requires video compression. C920 webcam uses H.264 encoded compression to provide high quality video at low bit rates

Full HD 1080p recording
Record videos in widescreen Full HD 1080p at 30 frames per second. The same H.264 encoded compression that enables high-definition video calls with Skype, also lets you capture great videos.

HD 720p video call quality
If Skype is not your favorite video-call service, C920 delivers HD 720p calling on most major instant messaging services.

Sharp, rich-color images
Smooth video quality, rich colors and clear sound in real-world environments are produced by Logitech Fluid Crystal™ technology.

Auto focus
C920 uses the same type auto-focus motor used in smartphone cameras. Optimized for webcams, the auto focus gives the sharpest image possible, even as close as 10 cm.

Carl Zeiss optics
To bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar® design into a five-element design. The new design focuses light onto the sensor with maximum detail and minimal distortion.

Stereo audio
A stereo recording or broadcast creates more of a sense of place; it creates a listening environment. Capture video or make a video call knowing that will be heard clearly and naturally.

Stable clip mount
Rubberized bumpers on the clip help hold C920 securely to your monitor or laptop. Also mount it to a tripod

15-megapixel snapshots
Capture brilliant, software-enhanced, 15-megapixel snapshots.

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

2240321,Camera_and_Photo,183042,"""Sony"""," ""Sony A7SII Alpha Series Mirrorless Digital Camera Body"" DSLM Body - Texas Media Systems""","""The Sony a7S II Mirrorless Digital Camera offers an impressive blend of sensitivity, dynamic range, resolution, and speed to benefit a versatile multimedia workflow. Starting with a full-frame 12.2MP Exmor CMOS sensor, the a7S II is capable of internal UHD 4K recording at 30 fps with full pixel readout as well as 1080p recording at up to 120 fps, all in the XAVC S format. For both stills and video recording, the BIONZ X image processor also pairs with the sensor to enable expanded sensitivity to ISO 409600, continuous shooting to 5 fps, and fast intelligent autofocus with low-light sensitivity to -4 EV. Further enabling working in difficult lighting conditions, 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE image stabilization compensates for vertical, horizontal, pitch, yaw, and roll camera movements for sharper, smoother handheld recording.


A7SII Features:
12MP Exmor CMOS sensor
RAW output 14 bit
Internal 4K recording with higher dynamic range
5 axis stabilization
Much improved AF in low light conditions (169 AF points)

With sensitivity settings that can extend up to ISO 409600 (Standard ISO range: 100-102400 for stills and movies. Expandable ISO range: 50-409600 for stills, 100-409600 for movies) plus extra-wide dynamic range, the Î±7S II can record images in spectacular and subtle detail, from shadows to highlights, under virtually any lighting conditions. The remarkable clarity and lack of noise in stills and movies that you shoot help provide the results that you've been aiming for.

Exmorâ¢ CMOS for extra sensor perception: Capture stills and movies of richer, more natural gradation. The 35mm full-frame 12.2-megapixel image sensor achieves wide dynamic range with very low noise throughout a vast ISO 50-409600 sensitivity span. Large pixels, gapless on-chip lens structure, and other light capture advances allow use of extra-high shutter speeds for low-light shooting.

The newly refined image processing algorithm of the BIONZ X optimizes image sensor performance for superior depiction of details in stills and movies throughout all sensitivity ranges. This image processing engine achieves image quality of such fine nuance and minimal noise, particularly at the mid- to high-sensitivity setting.

<br />
The MVH500A is a lightweight head with a wider platform for HDSLR bodies and the sliding plate travels to balance the latest interchangeable lens cameras. The entry-level 500 ensures smooth shots and fine control with up to 5kg (11 lbs) of equipment. <br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s the most compact head in our successful Bridging Technology&trade; range. <br />
MVH500A is supplied with a 60mm half ball video tripod mount and it also replaces the Manfrotto 701HDV video head. Beautifully smooth shots: the 500 has professional fluid cartridges on both pan and tilt axes to ensure that every camera movement is smooth, controlled and precise. <br />
<br />
Faster, easier and safer to use: the side lock system allows the camera and sliding QR plate to click quickly into the head from above, instead of needing to be aligned and slid in from the back. No secondary safety lock is necessary. The side lock system also makes it quicker and simpler to lift the camera out of the head from above. <br />
<br />
The 500 has a pre-set counterbalance of 2.4kg (5.3 lbs), but is able to support equipment of up to 5kg (11 lbs). The 500 has one Easy Link 3/8&rdquo; connector to allow an external monitor or other accessory equipment to be fitted. <br />
<br />
The MVT502AM video tripod is a traditional 2-stage, aluminium twin-tube video tripod that has professional features yet is designed to be intuitive, user-friendly and suited to lightweight applications. The MVT502AM has telescopic aluminium legs for compactness and reduced weight; its innovative ellipse-profile tubing with redesigned leg locking collars give it excellent levels of rigidity and stability. <br />
<br />
The first-stage spreader has improved ergonomics and ease of use, while the tripod&rsquo;s rubber feet improve grip on all floor and ground surfaces. A rubber strap ensures easier, safer transport. <br />

                            Full HD 1080p with Skype video calls
See and be seen in high-definition quality. Logitech partnered with Skype™ to deliver high-definition 1080p resolution with the C920 webcam.*

H.264 AVC compression
Get high-definition (HD) quality video at home or in the office. Real-time HD resolution over typical Internet connection bandwidths requires video compression. C920 webcam uses H.264 encoded compression to provide high quality video at low bit rates

Full HD 1080p recording
Record videos in widescreen Full HD 1080p at 30 frames per second. The same H.264 encoded compression that enables high-definition video calls with Skype, also lets you capture great videos.

HD 720p video call quality
If Skype is not your favorite video-call service, C920 delivers HD 720p calling on most major instant messaging services.

Sharp, rich-color images
Smooth video quality, rich colors and clear sound in real-world environments are produced by Logitech Fluid Crystal™ technology.

Auto focus
C920 uses the same type auto-focus motor used in smartphone cameras. Optimized for webcams, the auto focus gives the sharpest image possible, even as close as 10 cm.

Carl Zeiss optics
To bring you the best webcam images possible, Logitech and Carl Zeiss turned the classic four-element Zeiss Tessar® design into a five-element design. The new design focuses light onto the sensor with maximum detail and minimal distortion.

Stereo audio
A stereo recording or broadcast creates more of a sense of place; it creates a listening environment. Capture video or make a video call knowing that will be heard clearly and naturally.

Stable clip mount
Rubberized bumpers on the clip help hold C920 securely to your monitor or laptop. Also mount it to a tripod

15-megapixel snapshots

35mm Exmor R CMOS Sensor. The world's first full-frame sensor with back-illuminated structure, the Exmor R combines gapless on-chip lens design and anti-reflective coating on the surface of the sensor's glass seal to dramatically improve light collection efficiency. By switching to copper in the wiring layer, the transmission speed has increased â trumping this camera's predecessor, the a7R. The results? 42.4 Megapixel stills and 4K video with high sensitivity - up to ISO 102,4003.

5-axis SteadyShot. Internal image stabilization on the a7RII compensates for blur and camera shake from five different directions as opposed to two in previous systems. You can view the effects of this stabilization on your LCD when in movie mode.

4K Internal Recording. The Sony a7RII it the first DSLM to offer 4K, full-frame recording to internal media.

                                    Details
    The HXR-NX100 comes with Sony’s unique 20 mega pixel 1.0-type Exmor R back-illuminated CMOS sensor that delivers high resolution and fantastic low light performance, as well as offering more depth of field control as demanded by today’s diverse shooting requirements. Three independent manual lens rings provide excellent creative control. A fixed Sony G series lens achieves 12x optical zoom, which can be doubled to 24x with Clear Image Zoom making use of the 1.0 type sensor to still deliver a native resolution 1920x1080 image. You can also double the zoom again using a sophisticated Digital Extender for a maximum 48x zoom. There is also a ND Filter function, allowing you to choose four conventional mechanical ND filter positions that will enhance your ability to work in any shooting scenario.
Additional advanced features include dual media slots, “SIMUL” or “RELAY” recording, and independent record control. Recording formats are AVCHD, DV and XAVC S 50Mbps for multiple choices and high quality images. Professional audio quality is made easy thanks to XLR connectors as standard and Multi Interface (MI) Shoe supporting fully integrated wireless audio solutions, such as Sony’s UWP-D range.

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

Improvements like a powerful 24.2 Megapixel (APS-C) CMOS sensor and Dual Pixel CMOS AF for Live View shooting enhance the EOS 80D's performance across the board. Complementing the EOS 80D's advanced operation are built-in wireless connectivity and Full HD 60p movies that can be saved as MP4s for easy sharing.

It is designed with Canon's Optical Image Stabilizer technology and is compact and light. This high zoom ratio lens is equivalent to a focal length of 88-400mm in the 35mm format (when used on Canon EOS cameras compatible with EF-S lenses). The image stabilizer effect is equivalent to a shutter speed about 4 stops faster than the same size lens without Image Stabilizer. In other words, if the slowest shutter speed you could formerly hold a 250mm lens steadily was 1/250th of a second, with Canon's 4-stop stabilization correction, you could hand-hold at shutter speeds as slow as 1/15th of a second.

4K image quality
Shoot 4K footage that contains about four times more detail than Full HD (3840 x 2160 pixels vs. 1920 x 1080) footage, and capture more of the incredible qualities that bring images to vibrant life.




Extra-light, extra-compact body
The FDR-AX33 is over 30% smaller and over 20% lighter than current model the FDR-AX100, making it the most mobile 4K camcorder on the market.

 




Balanced Optical SteadyShot™
Our advanced image stabilization enables blur-free footage, even when the recording circumstances are shaky or bumpy.




Advanced shooting features
Enjoy total customization with ergonomic manual controls. Use the intuitive multi-purpose manual ring to adjust zoom, focus, exposure, IRIS, shutter speed, AE shift, or white balance shift mode after using the manual button to select the mode. The electronic viewfinder offers accurate image preview.




Super-sampled Full HD playback
Enhance your viewing experience even without a 4K television. Using super-sampling, the FDR-AX33 automatically down-converts 4K footage to exceptionally detailed Full HD.




Trimming Playback
You can select a specific portion of the picture and play it back in Full HD, thanks to 4K high resolution. Also, you can change trimming size2 with the zoom lever or on-screen display icon.

 




Multi Camera Control
More shots mean more editing opportunities. Easily record footage from a variety of angles, whether using cameras mounted directly to the FDR-AX33 or triggered wirelessly. Multi Camera Control makes it easy to sync shooting settings on all devices.

 




Live Streaming via Ustream®
From performances to sports events, some things are best seen in real time. Share scenes as they happen with high-quality picture and sound.

 



 


Highlight Movie Maker
A versatile function to streamline movie editing, Highlight Movie Maker offers several time-saving features. Add highlight points to key moments while recording, and let the camcorder automatically sync your transitions to your chosen soundtrack.




Exmor R™ CMOS sensor
This cutting-edge sensor enhances image clarity, reduces noise in dark environments, and enables soft background defocusing.

 




BIONZ X™ image processor
The advanced BIONZ X image processing engine helps achieve more naturally vivid and lifelike image quality as well as faster processing capabilities.

 




Wide-angle ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* lens
This 29.8mm wide-angle ZEISS lens providing 10x optical zoom is not only ideal for capturing grand landscapes, among a range of other scenes — it is fine-tuned specifically for 4K.

 




Exceptional image quality
By employing XAVC S format, which was developed from the XAVC format for professional use, 4K Ultra HD and high-bitrate recording of incredible quality are realised. Yet, XAVC S data is compressed so that it is more manageable for general consumers.

 




20.6MP still image capture
Sometimes you don’t need — or want — video. Put your video camera in still image mode and capture amazing high-quality single images as easily as you do with a still camera.

 




Superb night shooting
This feature uses infrared light to take pictures even in complete darkness. By using NIGHTSHOT, parents can easily capture children’s cute sleeping faces.

 




Motion Shot Video3
This convenient feature allows playback of a dramatic sequence of superimposed images to trace every split second of action, a powerful tool for analysing sports motion on screen. During playback, you can adjust the interval between images, or pause to capture still images to share with friends.

 




Dual Video Recording4
Record two movies at the same time — one in the maximum-quality XAVC S or AVCHD format and another in MP4 format. That way you’ve got a small file ready for instant sharing, plus a professional-grade file for further editing.




Face Detection and Smile Shutter5
Use Face Detection to optimise focus, exposure and colour for people who are the most important subject of a shot. You can prioritise a subject’s face by touching it on the LCD. And with Smile Shutter, the FDR-AX33 can also automatically capture still shots of great (but fleeting) smiles, even while recording movies.




Lock-on AF
Enhances the tracking of moving subjects by using the optimal AF point at all times, and adjusting the target frame size to match your subject’s characteristics. Thanks to advances in phase-detection AF, it’s now more accurate than ever — so lock on and shoot fast-moving targets with precision.

 




5.1ch microphone6
Record clear sound that accurately captures the atmosphere of the scene, and enjoy surround sound playback on your home theatre system. Level meters on the LCD panel provide visual monitoring of each channel’s levels.




Auto Wind Noise Reduction
Using an advanced sound-analysis algorithm, this feature eliminates wind noise — the biggest culprit of bad outdoor audio.

Reduce the intensity of behind-camera sounds, whether you are talking to or cheering on your subject as you shoot.



Golf Shot
Analyse your swing with no need for fancy equipment. Golf Shot mode lets you capture video and stills of each step of your swing.




Xtra Fine LCD with WhiteMagic™
The high-precision Xtra Fine LCD features a WhiteMagic display that uses white pixels in addition to RGB pixels to boost screen brightness, allowing users to see subtle details and tones on the screen in all types of shooting environments, including outdoors in bright sunlight.




Built-in USB cable
The built-in USB cable stowed in the hand strap is very convenient for extra-quick charging and connection to a PC, so there is no need to pack a bulky extra USB cable or AC adapter. For charging without a PC, use a compact AC-USB adapter (optional).

The processor also provides notable speed throughout the camera system, including the ability to record up to 7 fps in full-resolution, quickened AF speeds, and full HD 1080p video recording. The 3.0-inch Clear View II touchscreen LCD monitor profits greatly from the advent Dual Pixel CMOS AF system and its ability to utilize Touch AF focusing for finely controlled selection of the point of focus.

                            The Manfrotto MK190XPRO4-BHQ2 Tripod Kit w/ Ball Head is a 4-section aluminum tripod with a 90° center column mechanism, which allows the column to be extended vertically as normal or horizontally. This makes it an extremely versatile tripod, suitable for a wide range of photography applications. The horizontal column mechanism is housed within the tripod's top casting for compactness, but it is easily and quickly extended whenever you need it. Switching between vertical and horizontal column orientation requires no disassembly, and can even be done with a camera attached.  The legs of the tripod are also fast to extend and adjust, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers that block and unblock each leg section. The special design of the QPL levers allow a stronger and more comfortable single-handed leg lock grip.  The tripod’s top casting has an Easy Link connector to support a photo or video accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket, and transforming it into a practical mobile studio.

The XPRO Ball Head has a new triple locking system which guarantees camera position stability, friction control helping the user balance the weight of camera equipment and two levelling bubbles to precisely frame composition.  New polymer rings have substituted that unpleasant, messy grease, ensuring smooth, accurate and less jerky camera movement. XPRO Ball Head is portable, lightweight and reliable thanks to its magnesium body and comes with the Manfrotto 200 PL plate.

The new 190 allows you to create a portable photographic studio, thanks to the new ""Easy link"" plug, which enables instant connection between tripod and accessories, such as LED lights for Macro Photography and VDSLR applications through arms and brackets.  The new patented Rotating Leveling Bubble is quick to set up and allows you to position the tripod more precisely. It is easy to read, whatever the shape of the head or however the tripod is set up. The new Leg Angle Selectors are also easy to set up, as they are made following the most innovative ergonomic standards and prevent fingers and nails being trapped in the upper casting. The entire shape of the tripod has been modified and made more manageable and stylish. The complete re-design of its functional elements shows a particular attention to aesthetics and details.
